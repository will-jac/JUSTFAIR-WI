Daniels and Erickson agree. Court - 16CM15 - amend only count to county ordinance of possession of THC - pleads NC, finds G, fine of $300.00 plus costs totalling $582.50 - 60 DTP/CO after argument for longer time to pay/payment plan.

Court - 16CM16 - dismisses and reads in count #2. Daniels pleads NC to counts #1 and #3 as alleged.
