Par 3 - All 9 permitted convictions - Atty objects to all - based upon time, Ct states that all within 10 years - evidence comes in limited Miller can be asked if ever convicted of crime if she said yes and how many 9 , okay; Deloney - 16 - 8 relevant, 2010 and after - Atty no objection to any so 8 is the number;  Wolfe - only if testifies only information of prior conviction admissable - 26 listed - RDK submit all 26 - Atty - objection focus on first 10 within last 10 years,  # is 10 -  high number is things over 10 years old, old news, not relevant - so only if Wolfe testifies can be asked ever convicted and if he says yes, then 10 then state is barred from further discussion.   Defense - MIL:  Prohibition regarding prior DA incidents - Atty stipulate in morning to the priors and answers which will make issue irrelevant so wait until see the proposed stipulation.  Para 1 - RDK position - not knowing what they are going to stipulate too, state would have to prove that offense itself will be a domestic, repeater and dom repeater is for the court's determination and the dom abuse provision for jury if indicating willing to stipulate then the state probable would not be able to go into any of that.  Itent, motive?  Have not presented an other acts evidence.  Ct grants paraph 1 except for what the state has to prove in regarding to the dom ab st.  Paragraph 2 - no objection.  Paragraph 3 - sequ witnesses - state asking that Deputy Aaron assist at counsel table, would like them in during voire dire, Ct wants them here for voire dire.  Par. 3 is granted with understanding that witnesses be in for voire dire for identification.  Par 4 - RDK - Deputy Aaron assist as investigating officer, testify first, he is assisting counsel just be in order as state determines. Atty does not understand why he needs to assist - Ct satisfied that the state has to work thru agents and state may have an agent and atty here in court and the agent may be the officer, in terms of testifying in order that is attys discretion as to par 4 denied.  Par 5 - RDK - agree.   Granted.  Par 6. - Atty states that has been resolved.    Ct asks if anything else need to talk about?  - JI - way this is charged that it is a DC as a domestic, believe jury has to find if he comm the offense and if he finds guilty then they determine if a domes offense, not really a lesser included, does the court want the state to say dc a lesser included, special verdict?  Ct does not think it is a lesser included and wuld treat as a penalty enhancer.  Atty - clothes in jail, talked about wearing clothes, shackles in court?  11 year old witness - juvnile - informed by 2 other witnesses that she never saw anything, although police report said she did, initially sequestered outside of jury.  Ct - shackles, security - Wolfe will appear in civilian clothes without shackles and handcuffs on 3rd floor of courthouse.  11 year old witness  atty - foundation issue - Ct - RDK comments, Ct - credibility issue - deny the motion, does not go to her foundation goes to her credibility.  Not require witness to come in and give preliminary testimony.","parties":[],"descr":"Status conference","amount":null,"key":"2-2016CM000059-33","ctofc":"Eaton, Robert E","date":"2017-01-24","courtRptr":"Anderson, Gail"},{"addlTxt":"16CF216, 16CM59, and 16CT6.
