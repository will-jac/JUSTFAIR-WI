Atty Araysa Marie Simpson.  Def in custody.  Justine L Suleski appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\nSimpson:  I e-mailed Ms. Suleski about the recommendations but didn't get a response.  We would ask that the diversion not be revoked.  Def is doing an AODA and anger management in prison.  He's there for 3 years... It's my understanding that if it's revoked, it would be concurrent time.  I don't know how the court wants to proceed.  Suleski:  The time line was charges filed in Jan. 2016.  The Vernon Co. charges came in Dec., 2016.  The offense date was Apr., 2016 but the charges were filed after the diversion was filed.  He needed to tell Ms. Hickey of the new charges but didn't.  Simpson:  I don't know if he's obligated to disclose new charges.\nCourt:  What portion of the diversion agreement was violated?  Why do you belive the failure to notify- has he been in custody on bond prior to the conviction and sentence?\nMr. Ruehmann states he was in custody until the day I was sentenced.  Simpson:  I know one of the things they say he violated was the no alcohol.  Suleski:  It looks like he was released on a signature bond.  I can look at that more closely.  If he wasn't in custody until May of this year- the other things he was supposed to do-   Court:  I'm looking at the Vernon Co. case.  The complaint was filed Dec. 6th and the initial appearance was Dec 27th.  A signature bond was signed that same day.... The Info. was filed Jan. 6th and the PH was Jan. 30th.  Def states he wasn't locked up until June 19th.  Suleski:  He didn't do the AODA and DV assessment.... I do think there are grounds to revoke.  Simpson:  He is doing those exact things...\nCOURT:  The amended motion to revoke alleges several violations....  I'm understanding he was out of custody until June, 2017.  Those were not completed...  He didn't ask Ms. Hickey for any concessions... I'll find there was a violation of the diversion agreement and he made no attempt to communicate with Ms. Hickey.  THE MOTION TO REVOKE IS GRANTED.\nSimpson hasn't discussed the recommendations with him but I think he'll be okay with a concurrent sentence.\nCourt:  Is there a victim notification issue?\nSuleski:  The victim did not request notice of hearings....   Recommends concurrent jail would be appropriate.\nCourt:  Mr. Ruehmann, I granted the request to revoke.  The State is recommending concurrent time.  You have a couple of options.  1) you can ask for a continuance or 2) we can resolve it today.\nRuehmann:  There's no excuse for not following through with this...  I'm okay with a concurrent sentence.\nSENTENCE:  120 days CJ - concurrent with his current Vernon Co. sentence.   CC: $443 to be paid immediately or 10 days CJ - he can't pay so the 10 days will take care of that.","parties":[],"descr":"Deferred prosecution agreement hearing","amount":null,"key":"32-2016CM000166-27","ctofc":"Horne, Scott L","date":"2017-09-26","courtRptr":"Stello, Michelle"},{"addlTxt":"NA by def - Atty Simpson pres - just appointed requests continuance\nDPAH 9-26-17 @ 1:30 (SLH)","parties":[],"descr":"Deferred prosecution agreement hearing","amount":null,"key":"32-2016CM000166-26","ctofc":"Gonzalez, Ramona A.","date":"2017-08-24","courtRptr":"Frydenlund, Amy"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Electronic Notice Update","amount":null,"key":"32-2016CM000166-25","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-08-21","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Araysa Simpson","parties":[],"descr":"Public defender order appointing counsel","amount":null,"key":"32-2016CM000166-24","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-08-21","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"GLD: Request for attorney--rescheduled.","parties":[],"descr":"Prop.
