The Court finds that the defendant will benefit and society will not be harmed by expungment in this matter.  The Court will sign the order for expungment once the defendant shows proof of obtaining her high school diploma or its equivalent.  This must be done by 05-19-2017.  The Court will consider extending that time if the defendant is diligently working on completing it.  \nPay slip and DNA form given to Attorney Lambrecht for the defendant.\nMinutes.","parties":[],"descr":"Plea/sentencing hearing","amount":null,"key":"36-2016CM000145-9","ctofc":"Rohrer, Mark R.","date":"2016-05-19","courtRptr":"Anderson, Gina"},{"addlTxt":"Letter from Attorney Lambrech to MRR requesting defendant to appear by phone for plea date.","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"36-2016CM000145-8","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-05-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Settlement Conference Summary.\nPlea hearing is set for 05-19-16 at 2:00 p.m.","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"36-2016CM000145-7","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-04-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's Notice of Motion; Defendant's Demand and Motion for Discovery and Inspection.","parties":[],"descr":"Demand for discovery","amount":null,"key":"36-2016CM000145-6","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-04-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Anthony Lambrecht, public defender.","parties":[],"descr":"Public defender order appointing counsel","amount":null,"key":"36-2016CM000145-5","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-04-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Elizabeth D.
