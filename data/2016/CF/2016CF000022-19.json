Skarva and Enderby agree, defense is free to argue the probation sentence - puts on the record that the defendant is on pain medication. Enderby pleads NC to counts #2, #3 and #4 as alleged. Court has plea questionnaire, goes thru it, finds the defendant has freely, voluntarily and intelligently waived his constitutional rights by entering his plea and right to JT, accepts plea, adjudges guilty, dismisses and reads in counts #1, #5 and #6. Victim (TR) makes a statement in Court (1:39 PM). Victim's husband and boss would like to make a statement. Skarva objects to victim's husband and/or boss making a statement. Court doesn't need any further statements made. State makes final argument prior to sentencing - follow recommendation of 3 years of probation with conditions: AODA and follow thru, anger management and follow thru, obtain a psychological evaluation and follow thru with any recommendations, maintain absolute sobriety, no possession or consumption of alcohol and no entry into any bars, taverns or Class B establishments, 100 hours of community service - to be performed within the first year of probation as allowed and defined by WI law, maintain/obtain full time employment/school, take all medications as prescribed and in the manner in which they are prescribed, no contact with TR or allowed on any premises owned or occupied by her, costs on each count, restitution plus VW surcharge as previously stated. Skarva makes final argument prior to sentencing - recommends 1 year probation for stated reasons, objects to conditions of AODA and no entry into any bars, taverns or Class B establishments, PLEAS continued. State requests an additional condition of a written apology letter to the victim that she just requested. Skarva objects for stated reasons. State - restitution is for the small claims that was never paid by the defendant. State advised that the small claims has been paid, withdraws condition of restitution. Enderby makes statement. Court sentences the defendant to the following: counts #2, #3 and #4 - withhold sentence and place on probation for 3 years - concurrent to each other -  with conditions of: no contact whatsoever with TR or her family, not to go within 1000 feet of business, home or anywhere she is located, AODA and follow thru, anger management assessment and follow thru, psychological evaluation and follow thru, 100 hours of community service - to be completed within the first year of probation, write a sincere apology letter to the victim, costs on each count, submit DNA sample, felony rights given, right to appeal.
