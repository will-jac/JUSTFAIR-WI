The Court has been contacted by the PD office and you are eligible but they have not been able to find someone to represent you.  Mr. Kuehn wishes to proceed without an attorney.  Court advises of constitutional right of attorney.  Mr. Kuehn understands.  Court advises of maximum penalties of the charge.  Mr. Kuehn wishes to proceed and represent himself.  No objection by the State.  Court will proceed on the Pepin County Case only, not the Buffalo County Case.  Mr. Kuehn confirms receipt of the Revocation Order & Warrant with correction to time served and believe Mr. Theis was updated with that otherwise no objection.  Mr. Theis agrees and will prepare a memo to the Court if needed.  State's sentencing arguments and State in agreement with recommendation of 12 months incarceration in 16CF45 and interested to hear the calculation of time served as was unaware of any Menomonie sanction and not listed in the Revocation Report.  State ended up with 192 jail credit which includes time served on original sentence and don't have a firm # of jail credit.  If Agent Theis says all 60 were to apply to this case then 252.  If gets credit for good time that would be 274 with 22 days left to serve on this sentence.  Imagine he will be held on Buffalo County matter until that hearing.  Agent Theis forgot about the 60 days and not sure if for Pepin County or Buffalo County and could submit Memo to the Court.  Mr. Kuehn doesn't have the # of days of credit and would ask that court add 1 day to get a year and a day to get into the  program through Buffalo County sentence.  Agent Theis not opposed.  On 4/11/19 Mr. Theis was brought before the court for jail hold which believe is what he is referring to.  Court will go along with suggestion.  Court confirms Mr. Kuehn wishes to go ahead with his sentence.  He wishes.  Total length of sentence for count 1 is 3 years 1 month but will be a year a day as requested, addt'l term of confinement will be 1 year, 1 day and time serve on ES will be 2 years 0 months. Court reads condition of ES.  Find not eligible for Challenge Incarceration Program but eligible for Substance Abuse Program and if qualifies, be immediately released to ES.
