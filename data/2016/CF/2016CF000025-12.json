Appearances: Defendant William E Hampton, #151518 appeared by video means. D.A. Lukas Steiner via ZOOM video.\n     Court notes two motions filed by Mr. Hamptom -- motion addressening credit and motion addressing restitution.  Court denied a motion for sentence credit in May.  Def. comments on what he feels is new information.  Court notes the presentation was more complete this time, but the law previously referenced by the court is the same.  Def. states when the jail is unable to take a person and places on EM in their home, they are eligible for sentence credit.  D.A. states the matter has been heard and properly decided.  Court states case cited is directly on point with the facts in this case and no new case law referenced,   Court also reread sentencing transcript and had sentenced to less time in light of the in-home EM.  Court states the decision of the court still stands; the motion is denied for the reasons set forth on the record and in the decision of May 22, 2020.\n     As to restitution, Def. was asked why this was not addressed within 60 days of the judgment.  Court states the restitution was specifically addressed at the sentencing hearing.  D.A. states the request is untimely statutorily and failed to be preserved on appeal.  \n     Court denies motion to address restitution; request was not timely; sentencing transcript was reviewed and restitution was addressed and parties advised at that time; no restitution hearing was requested or conducted at the time of hearing or during the appeal.  Court will prepare a written order addressing each motion.  \n     Court concludes at 9:16 a.m.\n","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-145","ctofc":"Rider, Lynn Marie","date":"2021-07-16","courtRptr":"Bird, Jessica A"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Motion and order for withdrawal of counsel","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-144","ctofc":"Rider, Lynn Marie","date":"2021-07-01","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion and Order for Withdrawal of Counsel","parties":[],"descr":"Proposed Order","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-143","ctofc":null,"date":"2021-07-01","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for William E Hampton, #151518\nCurrent: PO BOX 900, Columbia Correctional Institution, Portage, WI 53901-0900 United States  (Effective: 03-18-2021)\nPrior: PO BOx 900, CCI, Portage, WI 53901-0900 United States\n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Hampton, William E"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-142","ctofc":null,"date":"2021-06-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Brief in Support to Credit 297 Days Home Detention Program Electronic Monitoring Towards Defendant Sentence","parties":[],"descr":"Brief","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-141","ctofc":null,"date":"2021-06-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"to Credit 297 Days Home Detention Program Electronic Monitoring Towards Defendant Sentence","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of motion, motion","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-140","ctofc":null,"date":"2021-06-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion hearing on July 16, 2021 at 09:00 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-139","ctofc":null,"date":"2021-05-24","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-138","ctofc":null,"date":"2021-05-07","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for William E Hampton\nCurrent: PO BOx 900, CCI - Inmate #151518, Portage, WI 53901-0900 United States  (Effective: 03-18-2021)\nPrior: 1006 Co Rd EE, PO box 900, RedGranite Correctional Institution, Redgranite, WI 54970-0900 United States\n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Hampton, William E"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-136","ctofc":null,"date":"2021-03-18","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"for Evidentiary Hearing About the March 7, 2017 $3000 dollars Restitution Imposed upon Defendant for Victim J.H.","parties":[],"descr":"Motion","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-135","ctofc":null,"date":"2021-03-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Letter from def requesting copies\nLetter from Clerk of Court to defendant","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-134","ctofc":null,"date":"2020-06-11","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for William E Hampton\nCurrent: 1006 Co Rd EE, PO box 900, RedGranite Correctional Institution, Redgranite, WI 54970-0900 United States  (Effective: 06-11-2020)\nPrior: PO Box 938, c/o Oakhill Correctional Institution, Oregon, WI 53575 United States\n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Hampton, William E"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-133","ctofc":null,"date":"2020-06-11","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Denying Motion for Sentence Credit","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"12-2016CF000025-132","ctofc":"Rider, Lynn Marie","date":"2020-05-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"for Sentence Credit and For Amended Judgment of Conviction Under Wis.
