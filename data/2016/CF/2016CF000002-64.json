Case called.  Appearances given.  \nDaniel A. Necci appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\nDeft Gabino Dominguez Gonzalez in court, in custody with Atty Michelle Marie Anderson.  \nInterpreter Sara Tapia appears on behalf of the Deft.  Interpreter was previously sworn.  \nMatter is before the Court on a couple of different matters.  \nCourt will address the McMorris issue first.  It seems to the Court that there is a basis for this evidence.  \nAtty Necci agrees but makes a further record as to the circumstances under which it would be allowed.  \nResponse by Atty Anderson.  \nDiscussion between Court and Attys concerning Sullivan analysis.  \nParties agree there is no need for Sullivan analysis because it is coming in under McMorris.  \nCourt next addresses the State's Motion for Other Acts Evidence.  \nThe Defense is not conceding to the State's Motion.  \nArgument by Atty Anderson that the statements are very generalized and there is no specificity.  \nArgument by Atty Necci.  \nResponse by Atty Anderson.  \nCourt finds that the argument goes to the weight and not the admissibility of the evidence so the Court does not see it as something that would not be coming in. \nDiscussion concerning:  Motive, Intent and Plan\nAtty Anderson concedes motive and intent are permissible purposes but not plan.  Atty Necci agrees.  \nAtty Anderson concedes as to Paragraphs 11, 12, 13 coming in.  \nDiscussion between Court and Attys with regard to paragraph 14.  \nAtty Anderson doesn't believe it fits under motive or intent.  \nResponse by Atty Necci.  \nCourt will move on to step 2 of the analysis - relavancy - and come back to step 1\nDiscussion between Court and Attys.  \nCourt believes we need more information before a relevancy determination can be made.  \nQuestion by Atty Necci as to whether this could be addressed in an offer of proof at trial?\nResponse by Court that it would be up to the State to determine how they wish to handle this.  \nAtty Anderson requests it be determined prior to the date of trial.  \nResponse by Atty Necci with regard to DA's policy of limiting the number of interviews with child witnesses.  \nCourt is going to deny request with respect to that specific evidence and will allow the State to bring it back if they get more specificity.  \nDiscussion concerning scheduling of Jury Trial.  \nThere will be a Judicial rotation in August.  \nClerk will contact the Attys via e-mail with proposed FPT and JT dates.  \n10:48 am  Court in recess.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT FILED 4/12/2017 COURT REPORTER EILEEN GRZENIA**","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000002-26","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2016-04-08","courtRptr":"Grzenia, Eileen"},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's Response in Support of Defense Motion in Limine Admitting McMorris Evidence for Self-defense Claim.","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000002-25","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-03-28","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"State's Brief in response to the Defendant's Motion in Limine to Admit McMorris Evidence","parties":[],"descr":"Brief","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000002-24","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-03-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Tapia","parties":[],"descr":"Spanish interpreter","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000002-23","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2016-03-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Gabino  Dominguez Gonzalez in court, in custody with attorney Michelle Marie Anderson.
