All other parties as follows in the Richland County Courtroom:  Defendant Christopher B. Vine in court, in custody of the sheriff, with attorney Adrian Wayne Longacre. Prosecuting Atty Michelle L Viste appeared for State of Wisconsin in 15CF90 and 16CF42. Prosecuting Atty. Jennifer Harper appeared for the State of Wisconsin in 16CF43.  15CF90 called as motion hearing on defense' motion to modify bond.  16CF42 and 16CF43 called for initial appearance, complaints in those matters filed yesterday.\n\n16CF42 and 16CF43 - Court conducts the initial appearances, stating the charges and informing def of the possible max. penalties.  \n\nCourt asks AGA Viste for clarification as some of the charges in 15CF90 and 16CF42 appear to be the same.  AGA Viste addresses the Court - moves for dismissal, without prejudice, of 15CF90.  No objection from the defense. 15CF90 dismissed.\n\nCourt asks prosecutors for their requests on bond. \n\nIn 16CF42, AGA Viste makes request for 50K cash bond, providing State's rationale for the high cash request.  Vista asks for bond conditions to include \"No contact with AB, Judge Sharp, KM, WG, TF, or SPW,\"  Additionally, Viste asks for 940.47 finding for no contact while def in custody.\n\nIn 16CF43, DA Harper asks for 10K cash bond with condition that def not violate any rules of the jail; also asks for request to deny request of def for a property bond in lieu of a cash bond.  Harper notes that, generally, this jurisdiction does not grant property bonds on the premise that, if a party has equity in a property, the proper procedure is for a def to get a loan from a bank (in order to get the equity out of that property).  Harper states that the state/county has no interest in taking people's property if they violate bond; notes property may not be in the name of the defendant.  Atty. Longacre addresses the Court with the defense' request on bond - asks for the property bond, noting that the property is in def's name and has enough equity to cover the bond amount; states that def cannot get an equity bond while he is in custody; also argues that def has health issues that make it difficult for him to be in jail.\n\nRuling on bond:  16CF42 - Court notes additional criminal basis stated in the complaint filed by the AG; notes concerns re alleged threats; refers to bond statute re factors of consideration.  Court sets bond at $50,000 cash with conditions of no contact whatsoever with AB, Judge Sharp, KM, WG, TF or SPW.  Additionally, no contact with any of those individuals while in custody per 940.07.  16CF43 - Court sets bond at $10,000 cash with same conditions as the bond in 16CF42 except that there is an additional condition that def not violate any jail rules.\n\nCourt notes that prelim hearings need to be set in these two matters.  DA Harper asks that these cases be joined for prelim.  Court sets prelim in both cases for 3/16 at 1:30.\n\nDefendant remanded to the custody of the sheriff.
