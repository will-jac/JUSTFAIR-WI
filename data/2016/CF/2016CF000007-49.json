Defendant Gregory J. Jung appeared by phone. Prosecuting Atty Michael Daniel Zell appeared for State of Wisconsin.\nBoth files heard: 16CF7 (sentencing on Count 3 only) and 15CF375 ( to address sentence credit)\n9:03 a.m.  Court calls the cases. \n\nCourt reviews the files. \nIt is the courts understanding that the defendant did not need to be present today. \nAtty Zell makes statements to the Court.  All parties agreed to have the defendant appear by telephone. \nAtty Weiland concurs. \nCourt questions the defendant. \nDefendant concurs. \n\nCourt questions if victim has received notice. \nAtty Zell make statements re: victim not having responded or requested notice. \nState has complied with Victim Notification Statutes.\nVictim is not present.\n\nAtty Zell makes sentencing arguments to the Court. \nAtty Weiland does not wish to be heard. \nDefendant makes statements to the Court.  Wishes to address sentence credit. \nCourt reviews the file further. \nAtty Zell makes statements.  Agrees what credit should be.  Written stipulation has not been signed yet.  Agrees there are 621 days credit on 15CF375.  \nCourt notes credit should be determined by DOC on imposed and stayed sentences.  Questions Atty Weiland. \nAtty Weiland responds.  Believed they needed to reach an agreement on 15CF375 for credit. \nCourt believed they would be addressing sentencing credit in 16CF7. \nAtty Weiland makes statements and agrees there are 408 days credit as of the time of the SAR hearing on November 28, 2018. \nDefendant agrees with that amount. \nCourt questions the defendant re: credit given by the DOC on 15CF375.  \nDefendant indicates DOC only gave him 90 days credit on 15CF375.  He is disputing that amount. \nCourt questions Atty Weiland. \nAtty Weiland indicates on 15CF375 they had calculated 621 days of credit.  \nCourt reviews the SAR packet in 15CF375. \nAtty Weiland makes statements.  Incarcerated 9/25/15 to 9/27/16 which is 368 days.  Also incarcerated on 3/20/17 to 11/28/17 which is 253 days. \nCourt reviews the file in 15CF375.  \nCourt questions Atty Weiland further. \nAtty Weiland responds.  \nCourt questions the defendant re: Stipulation and Order in 15CF375.\nDefendant indicates he sat on the bond for that case. \nAtty Zell makes statements.  At that time, the defendant was also serving a sentence.  Once he starts serving his sentence, the credit for the bond does not count. \nAtty Weiland makes additional statements to the Court.  It appears that he would not get the credit because he started serving his sentence pursuant to the Beets case. \nCourt questions the defendant and informs the defendant of credit not received at the time a sentence starts, the cases sever. \nDefendant makes statements to the Court. \nAtty Weiland speaks with his client re: credit. \nDefendant makes additional statements to the Court re: the credit for the later dates. \nCourt informs the defendant he does not have enough information to address the jail credit on 15CF375.  \nAtty Weiland makes additional statements to the Court.  Parties were not aware of the previous 101 days of credit that was stipulated too or that he was potentionally serving a sentencing at that time.  So there may need to be some recalculations of the sentence credit. \nAtty Zell makes additional statements.  Does not believe they have enough information at this time to stipulate to the credit in 15CF375 today. \nDefendant questions what credit he will be given on 16CF7 count 3. \nAtty Weiland makes statements.  \n\nBY THE COURT:  \n16CF7 Count 3 - \n4 years prison with 2 years Initial Confinement followed by 2 years Extended Supervision, concurrent with all other sentences. \n408 days credit as of 11/28/2017.  \nPay costs including the DNA surcharge. \nConditions of Extended Supervision will be identical to the terms of Extended Supervision that he has in his other cases. \nEligible for CIP and SAP programs. \nCopy of Written Explanation is to be sent to the Defendant. \n\nJOC to be amended to reflect he was sentenced on Counts 1, 2 & 3.  JOC for all 3 counts should reflect 408 days pre-trial incarceration credit as of 11/28/2017. \n\nWith regards to 15CF375 - The court was not aware that there was any dispute prior to todays date since there had been a stipulation re: credit.  \nCourt notes the DOC in the Revo Order and WArrant refers to this case and talks about credit with holds from 3/20/2017 to the court date.  It did not distinguish out the files and credits or the stipulation for the 101 days.  Atty Weiland may want to speak to his client with what DOC has given him and work on a stipulation.
