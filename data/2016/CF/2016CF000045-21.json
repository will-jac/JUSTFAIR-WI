Cveykus asks the Court to sentence on the revocation matter first. Court will take pleas prior to sentencing on all matters. State has complied with victim notification requirements on both new cases and has no response from Officer Wilson on 16CF45 and has received feedback from victim on 15CM162. Bird agrees with plea agreement as stated by his counsel. Court - 15CM162 - dismisses and reads in count #1, Bird pleads G to count #2 as alleged.
