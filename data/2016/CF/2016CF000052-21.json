State and counsel are prepared to proceed and both have received a copy of the PSI. State - no amendments, changes or modifications needed as far as he is concerned. Limbeck - does not believe anything dramtically affects his client refers to page 14 in regards to someone being deceased, clarifies the record. Court so notes but does not think it makes any difference in regards to the PSI. No testimomy today, just argument by counsel. State makes a remark in regards to it looks like the only order for PSI was on 15CF70 and that is the only case that a PSI was done on. Limbeck notices that as well now that the State has brought it to his attention. Both parties will be referencing the minutes from the 7/25/17 in regards to sentence recommendations. After further discussion, parties remember that the PSI was only supposed to be done on 15CF70 and they had an agreement on the other two cases, 16CF29 and 16CF52. Court agrees and will proceed today. State makes final argument prior to sentencing recommendation - on 16CF29 - 180 days jail - ordered first with prison term to run consecutive to this case - State asking for consecutive time but defense is free to argue for concurrent time; 16CF52 - withhold sentence and place on probation for 2 years - consecutive to 15CF70 - with defense free to argue on concurrent or consecutive. Limbeck agrees.

Court has question on State's recommendations in regards to 15CF70, clarifies that the prison time requested on that case is concurrent or consecutive to each other. State - concurrent to each other. Limbeck makes final argument prior to his recommendations - recommends conditional jail time and time to report to allow him to serve his sentence in the Shawano County Jail.
