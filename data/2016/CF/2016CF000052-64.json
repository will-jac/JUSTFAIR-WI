Case called.  Appearances given.  \nADA Matthew R. Leusink appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  \nDefendant Jeffrey S. McKenzie in court with attorney Jennifer Flynn.  \nMatter is before the Court for a number of motions that have been filed by the defense.  \nCourt will start with the Motions in Limine.  \n1) - State is in agreement with this; Atty Leusink designates his court officer; and requests victim be allowed to be present; Court will enter exclusion order with regard to other witnesses; Witnesses may be in courtroom to be introduced to jurors during voir dire but would then be excluded; \n3)  Other acts - no objection by the State;  \n5)  Reference to \"victim\" in presence of jury.  Argument by Atty Flynn.  Argument by Atty Leusink.  Court denies motion to have Court prohibit any reference by the State to K.M. as the victim.  Court does not believe this would be unfairly prejudicial.  \n6)  A request for an Order prohibiting State from introducing any evidence of the pursuit/chase.  Argument by Atty Flynn.  Atty Leusink has nothing to add to his written response.  Court denies this Motion in Limine.  Court finds this evidence is relevant.  Probative value is not substantially outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice.  Court would not allow multiple officers to testify to this evidence.  Court finds that would be cumulative.  7)  Notes / memo books to be turned over ahead of time - Atty Leusink will send out a follow up to the Officers as to whether these records exist.  And if they do exist, they are to be turned over promptly to the State and then the State is to provide them to the defense.  To be submitted to defense by April 1st if they exist.  \n8)  Order relating to any statements by the defendant to law enforcement officers.  If necessary court would have a Miranda/Goodchild motion.  Court schedules Miranda/Goodchild hearing - April 13, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. (1hour).  Court returns to 4) of the Motions in limine - Court has reviewed materials submitted by both the Defense and the State.  There has to be a factual basis to support a self-defense claim.  Atty Flynn provides offer of proof as to what her client would be testifying to at trial relating to self-defense.  Court needs to determine whether there is a basis to support self-defense.  Response by Atty Leusink.  Court cannot make a decision today as to whether the McMorris evidence is admissible.  Court thinks there needs to be a factual basis to support self defense before reputation and McMorris evidence can be presented.  Court believes it is a little premature at this point.  Response by Atty Flynn.  If Court makes finding that a factual basis has been raised to support self defense, reputation evidence can be used to establish victim's conduct.  Atty Flynn list witnesses she would call.  Court makes finding that prong 1 of analysis has been made.  Court addresses prong 2 of analysis;  Atty Flynn makes offer of proof as to what witnesses would say as to victim's reputation.  11:35 am  Response by Atty Leusink.  11:35 am  Response by Atty Flynn.  Court finds that 4 people testifying as to the same thing when they are all part of the same community is cumulative.  Court would expect the defense would limit this to 2 of these people who would give evidence or testify as to reputation / opinion.  \n11:38 am  Court deals with McMorris motion.  Response by Atty Leusink to Court's questions as to his position.  Argument by Atty Flynn.  Court makes record as to when this can and cannot be asked of the victim by the defense.  Letters a, b and c do show specific instances of conduct by the victim with regard to violence / aggressive behalf.  Court believes they do meet the criteria under McMorris and are admissible to show her state of mind if self-defense is shown.  As to d, Court does not think that is the type of specific incident of conduct that would apply to McMorris evidence.  Court believes it would be unfairly prejudicial.  11:48 am  Argument by Atty Flynn.  Response by Atty Leusink.  Further argument by Atty Flynn.  11:53 am  Court makes further record and will not allow \"d\";  Court next addresses item \"e\" of motion;  Atty Flynn makes record with regard to incident involving \"pulling the child's ponytail\".  11:55 am  Response by Atty Leusink.  11:56 am  Court makes record that it preliminarily meets test for being relevant and might be probative and not outweighed by any unfair prejudice so Court will allow it.  \n11:58 am  Atty Flynn makes regard with regard to defense motion to review victim's employee records.  Atty Flynn argues that these are not privileged records.  \n12:02 pm  Response by Atty Leusink.  \n12:03 pm  Court makes record and denies request as to employment records of victim.  \n12:05 pm  Court in recess.","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000052-78","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2017-01-30","courtRptr":"Matoska, Linda"},{"addlTxt":"DA service fees - $160.00","parties":[],"descr":"Invoice/Statement","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000052-79","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-01-25","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"K.M.M.","parties":[],"descr":"Certificate of service","amount":0.00,"key":"64-2016CF000052-77","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-01-25","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"P.S.M.","parties":[],"descr":"Certificate of service","amount":0.00,"key":"64-2016CF000052-76","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-01-25","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Case Converted to Electronic Filing","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000052-75","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-01-25","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Received documents","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000052-71","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-01-18","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"State's Response to Defendant's Motion in Limine to Prohibig Reference to \"Victim\"","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000052-74","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-01-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"State's Brief in Response to the Defendent's Motion to Admit McMorris Evidence","parties":[],"descr":"Brief","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000052-73","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-01-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"State's Response to Defendent's Motion in Limine to Prohibit Evidence of \"Chase\" Testimony","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000052-72","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-01-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Received documents","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000052-70","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-01-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"File Retained Electronically","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000052-69","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-01-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Motion in limine","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000052-64","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-12-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's Notice of Motion and Motion to Admit McMorris Evidence","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of motion, motion","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000052-63","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-12-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion to review employee disciplinary records of Kelly McKenzie","parties":[],"descr":"Motion","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000052-62","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-12-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Jeffrey S.
