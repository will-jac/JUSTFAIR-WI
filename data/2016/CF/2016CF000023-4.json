Cleaning staff directed officer to the images; secured images; was invited into the home; cleaning staff were hired by Bayfield County; only thing removed were the suspected images; did not conduct a search of the home; obtained a search warrant next day.\nAtty Latzig objects to testimony, not relevent.  DA Bourg responds; another aspect to discovery.  Court allows questioning to continue by DA Bourg.  Based on training and experience, explains process used to secure evidence; building was locked up when left; was informed by cleaning staff some items had been removed from the home by def's brother.  Court questions the witness; black and white printed images from printer; seized suspicious discs.  Cross by Atty Latzig; Mr. LaGrew was not present when he got to the home; cleaning staff were not residents of the home;  no warrant when initially entered the home; cleaning staff did have keys to lock up the home.
