Atty David Andrew Bolles by phone.  Brian Keith Barton appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\nCourt addresses JSS violations - positive tests and missed tests.  Bolles comments.  She's been testing continuously since May.  No problems until Nov.  The case is pretty much resolved and set for plea in March.  The strict house arrest is causing problems with her children.  Asks the Court to consider some other alternative.  Rondeau-Wilbur:  The house arrest isn't a problem except every other weekend when I have my children.  I go to Viroqua.  It's hard to get them to where they need to go.  Spoke to JSS about my missed tests.  I got the warrant and got scared and didn't come and test.  Barton thinks the violations are concerning...  Strict testing is appropriate as is house arrest.  Would like to go to my parents house every other weekend to be with my children.\nCOURT:  As long as JSS has your parents address, I don't see any reason they can't monitor that.  Any other reports like this and there will be an order to detain.  You're to be allowed reasonable amount of time to be active in your children's activities.  Other than thay, you're to be at your parents house.\nNew address:  1403 Redfield St., La Crosse, WI  54601\n\ne-JSS","parties":[],"descr":"Hearing","amount":null,"key":"32-2016CF000027-5","ctofc":"Horne, Scott L","date":"2016-01-13","courtRptr":"Stello, Michelle"},{"addlTxt":"David Bolles","parties":[],"descr":"Public defender order appointing counsel","amount":null,"key":"32-2016CF000027-4","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-01-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Def in custody w/Atty O'Neil for Bolles\n  Pretrial report filed\nCash bond posted in 15CF693 to also cover 16CF27 w/same cond and new cond: no CS w/o Rx, comply w/JS w/testing, GPS for house arrest\nPH: 1/19 @ 11 (GLD)","parties":[],"descr":"Initial appearance","amount":null,"key":"32-2016CF000027-6","ctofc":"Horne, Scott L","date":"2016-01-11","courtRptr":"Stello, Michelle"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Responsible court official changed","amount":null,"key":"32-2016CF000027-3","ctofc":"Lacrosse County, Unassigned","date":"2016-01-11","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"File Retained Electronically","amount":null,"key":"32-2016CF000027-2","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-01-11","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Complaint filed","amount":null,"key":"32-2016CF000027-1","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-01-11","courtRptr":null}],"prosAgency":"District Attorney","citations":[],"defAttys":[{"name":"Bolles, David Andrew"}],"balanceDue":0,"allowPurchase":false},"view":{"caseNo":{"value":"2016CF000027"},"countyNo":{"value":32}}}
