Diedrick in court with attorney Erik C. Johnson.  Scott C. Blader appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Court has reviewed State's Second MIL filed 4/19/2017.  State requests ruling on 2nd MIL regarding Def's treatment records.  DA believes records have no bearing on defense.  Argument by Atty Johnson - believes records are relevant and leaves to the Court's discretion.   Evidentiary value of post event treatment records extinguished, absent some degree of symmetry between charged event and 1st UA taken to provide some type of quantification - records are not relevant to the issue being tried and further determines that any commentary provided to provider would have a self serving nature to it - inadmissible hearsay.  Admission declined of post event treatment records.  As to squad video - some pausing will be required due to technology requirements.  Court orders that any audio to be marked and admitted to alleviate stenographer's record being taken.  DA makes the Court aware of muted issues and defense issues.  Atty Johnson has provided the Court with a transcript - proprietary software an issue and come portions cannot be heard.  Transcript may serve no purpose for trial today.  Court believes jury should draw their own conclusions based upon what is being heard.  Transcript would provide an interpretive commentary - evidentiary value to be assigned by the jury.  Atty Johnson argues as to 2nd hand smoke exposure to the children.  DA was not anticipated to bring in during case in chief.  State reserves the right.   Court sees absolutely relevant and State can bring in during case in chief and is entitled to bring in relevant information - permitted if State wishes to introduce.
