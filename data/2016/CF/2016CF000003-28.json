They will get notice, in due course, of any action the Court untimately takes on the posted bails.  \nAttorney Hartley orally Motions to Modify the Bond to reduce the amount.  \nADA Shock indicates that the State is not prepared to respond to this Motion today. \nThe Court schedules the oral Motion to Modify Bond on October 3rd;  the Court will not require the Defense to file a Notice of Motion and Motion,  \nrecess 1:20pm \n\n\n\nNEXT:   (1) Bail Motion Hearing on 10/3/16 at 3:00pm- Attorney Hartley will call in to appear by telephone for this hearing  (2) schedule a Bail Forfeiture Hearing in Cases #16CF3 and #16CF7--the sureties are not to be sent notices of hearing on this  (3) Status Conference on all cases on all cases on 12/13/16 at 10:30am","parties":[],"descr":"Status conference","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000003-83","ctofc":"Wambach, David J.","date":"2016-09-30","courtRptr":"Gwidt, Rachel L"},{"addlTxt":"Court's response to 9/27/16 letter from Defendant","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000003-91","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"From the defendant regarding scheduling a Bond Modification Hearing.","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000003-82","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-27","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Letter from the State advising that the Defendant was in custody at the Jefferson County Jail on the date and time of the Bond Forfeiture Hearing","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000003-81","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-27","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Cash bond forfeited","amount":500.00,"key":"28-2016CF000003-80","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-26","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Cash bond forfeited","amount":500.00,"key":"28-2016CF000003-79","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-26","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"cc: DA, Def. , Attorney Hartley, Natividad Bonilla & Alberto Bonilla on 9/22/16 sf","parties":[],"descr":"Judgment of bail/bond forfeiture","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000003-78","ctofc":"Wambach, David J.","date":"2016-09-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"From defendant regarding missed appearance for 9/19/16 BBH.","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000003-77","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-20","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"[MK] cases #16CF3 and #16CF7 called at 11:11am. \nDefendant Jorge Luis Bonilla Galan not in court.
