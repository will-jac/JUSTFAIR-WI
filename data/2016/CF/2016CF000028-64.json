Case called.  Appearances given.   \nAtty Andrew R Herrmann appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  \nDeft Raymond E. Hogan in court, in custody with Atty Mark S Rosen.  \nMatter is before the Court on a couple of different matters:    \nDeft's Motion to Dismiss because of lack of probable cause.  State's Other Acts Evidence and a previously filed Motion to Suppress filed by Atty Flitcroft.  \nAtty Rosen has a copy of Mr. Flitcroft's Motion.  The State however never received a copy of the Motion to Suppress filed by Atty Flitcroft.  Since the State was not aware of this Motion, no witnesses have been subpoened and the State cannot go forward with that Motion today.  Atty Rosen indicates that the last time that he was in court, he advised DA Necci that he needed the police reports for the other acts motion.  DA Necci never provided him with those reports.  Atty Herrmann states that the notes in their file indicate that Atty Rosen could check out the police reports.  The DA's file was available to be checked out.  Court is going to write it off as a misunderstanding between DA Necci and Atty Rosen.  Atty Rosen states he was told by DA Necci that he would mail them.  \n9:06 am  Court deals with Motion to Dismiss.  Court makes record and denies the Motion for being untimely.  Response by Atty Rosen that Atty Flitcroft indicated it took quite a while to get the transcript from the preliminary hearing.  He didn't get the transcript until 45 days later.  He would not have an issue for arguing the motion without first having and reviewing the transcript of the preliminary hearing.  Court does not believe the issue was properly preserved by Atty Flitcroft.  Court's decision stands.  Court reschedules the Motion to Suppress and the Other Acts Evidence Motion to September 6, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. (2 hours).  9:12 am  Court in recess.  \n\n**07/19/2016 - Transcript FILED;  Court Reporter:  Sandra Elderbrook  (df)","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000028-47","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2016-07-01","courtRptr":"Elderbrook, Sandy"},{"addlTxt":"June 30, 2016 Letter of Atty Andrew Herrmann with regard to various Motions that have been filed","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000028-48","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-06-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"June 30, 2016 Letter of Atty Mark S.
