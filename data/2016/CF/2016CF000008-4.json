Latzig does agree with this.  DA informs the Court the operator was Haley Nye, R.C. Officer.  Oath was given to child, page 3.  Court takes a break.  Back on the record.  DA, did not find the actual oath for child in the transcript, just discussion about telling the truth.  State has complied w/stats; child will be present for cross by defense; request child be able to testify by closed circuit.  Latzig responds; stats required both informing and understanding of telling the truth.  Court-908.08 motion; 9 yrs old at interview; opinion information re: camera operator has been given to defense at this point; child was asked about truth and lie, she understood and agreed to tell the truth; recording enhanced, not edited/altered, appears to be accurate and complete and provided to defense some time ago; spirit of the stats the recording has static but not intended to cover up statements, transcript is provided of the interview; allows 908.08 motion.  \nMotion for testimony outside of courtroom, DA comments to the Court.  Latzig objects.  DA responds, recites case law.  Court: allow child to testify by closed circuit w/some kind of proof of mental harm from a family member.  \nMotions in Limine; # of previous convictions for impeachment, two prior conviction.  Latzig argues.  Court: # of prior convictions will be 2, Latzig retains right to renew objection.\nSeq. of witnesses granted.  DA may ask for Officer Cadotte as Agent, Latzig has no objection.  Latzig informs the Court she may still obtain discovery.  \nMotion to Reconsider can be dealt with at the same time as the Daubert Motion; Court informs Attys when the request to ext. time was granted, JA was on vacation so may not have been relayed to DA.  DA questions the Court if it is necessary to reschedule JT, what timeframe would parties be looking at?  Court: not sure this case could be completed within 3 days considering the need to still address the open motions.  DA responds, not asking for the JT to be rescheduled, asks for TSC later this week; Remove JT from the September dates.  DA informs there may be add'l motion to be filed.  Latzig requests add'l time to respond.\n  Telephone scheduling conference scheduled for September 1, 2016 at 09:15 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-84","ctofc":"Yackel, John M.","date":"2016-08-29","courtRptr":"Biskup, Candace"},{"addlTxt":"Motion to reconsider filed by DA","parties":[],"descr":"Motion","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-83","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-25","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's motion to compel discovery and order for \"in camera\" review of counseling and treatment records of alleged victim (Shiffra motion)","parties":[],"descr":"Motion","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-82","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's motions in limine","parties":[],"descr":"Motion in limine","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-81","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Minutes Filed","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-80","ctofc":"Yackel, John M.","date":"2016-08-19","courtRptr":"Biskup, Candace"},{"addlTxt":"Motion to disallow witness filed by DA","parties":[],"descr":"Motion","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-79","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-16","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's list of witnesses w/attach C.V. for Dr. Thompson","parties":[],"descr":"Witness list - defendant","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-78","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"States response to request for modification of bail","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-77","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Response to defendant's motion to compel discovery request for a protective order","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-76","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Subpoena and Certificate of Appearance for witness to appear and give evidence on August 29, 2016 at 9:00 a.m. issued to C.A.B.","parties":[],"descr":"Subpoena","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-75","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-02","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Subpoena and Certificate of Appearance for witness to appear and give evidence on August 29, 2016 at 9:00 a.m. issued to K.C.","parties":[],"descr":"Subpoena","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-74","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-02","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion hearing on August 19, 2016 at 09:15 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-73","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-07-27","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion hearing on August 29, 2016 at 09:00 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"4-2016CF000008-72","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-06-27","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Letter from Atty.
