ADA Monica Hall appears for the State of Wisconsin.\nAttorney Kramer indicates that the Defense is withdrawing its opposition to the State's Motion for Joinder and the related State's Other Acts Motion.   \nOn stipulation of the parties, the Court grants the State's Motion for Joinder of Crime; this renders moot the Other Acts Motion that relates to the charges that are now joined for trial.\nAfter the Court and counsel discuss proceeding to trial on the two case numbers, the Court directs the State to prepare an Amended Information that includes all the counts.  \n---------------------------------\n\nAttorney Kramer informs the Court that the Defense is withdrawing its Case #15CF406 Motion to Suppress both evidence and statements.  Attorney Kramer provides information on the bases for the Defense withdrawing this Motion.   \nThe Court allows the Defense to withdraw the Motion, and the Court finds the subject evidence and statements will be admissible at trial. \n--------------------------------\n\nIn regard to the issues raised regarding the statement of Mr. Gutermuth that was taken at the Jail on 8/15/15 by Detective Brown, the Court directs the Defense to be prepared to inform the Court tomorrow whether they intend to pursue the Miranda-Good challenge regarding the statement. \n--------------------------------\n\nEvidence is taken on the Defense Motion to Compel Disclosure of Confidential Informants CI1 and CI2:  \nDet.

Davis- sworn & testifies\n--direct examination by ADA Hall\n--cross examination by Attorney Kramer \nArguments on the Motion given by counsel.  ADA Hall indicates that the State does not intend to admit the subject text messages, however the State has no objection to the Defense admitting such evidence. \nThe Court rules that the recipients of the text messages are mere tipsters; they are not transactional witnesses, so the Defense Motion to have the Court compel the State to release identity-information on CI1 and CI2 is denied.  The Court indicates that if the Defense chooses to present evidence of the texts from Z. Johnson's telephone, the Defense will be allowed to do so.\n-----------------------------------\n\nAfter Attorney Kramer indicates that the Defense is not opposing the 11/11/16 State's Motion to Admit Other Acts, the Court grants this Motion.\nDuring arguments on the State's Other Acts Motions dated 11/28/16,  counsel agree that the Defense may present the entire recording of the subject 11/18/15 interview of Z. Johnson so that the context of the communication during the interview is provided.  Thereafter, on agreement of the parties, the Court grants the Motion:  the State will be allowed to admit this Other Acts evidence.\n-------------------------------------  \n\nThe Court addresses the State's Motion regarding Expert Testimony.   After brief discussion with counsel, the Court grants the Motion with the clarification that the witness-Medical Examiner Jessica Lelinski may testify about independant conclusions reached based on her review of the autopsy report. The Court will allow the State to present the testimony of toxicologist Sara Schreiber. \n---------------------------------------------\nThe Court grants the State's 11/11/16 Motion to Impeach the Defendant with three prior convictions. \nThe Court informs Mr. Gutermuth of his right to testify and the procedure that will be involved with testifying. The Court informs Mr. Gutermuth of his right not to testify and the instruction the Court will give to the Jury about this right.  The Court informs Mr. Gutermuth of the statutory method for questions that will be posed related to impeachment with prior convictions, if Mr. Gutermuth would chose to testify.\nIn regard to the State's 11/11/16 Notice of Convictions for State's Witnesses, the Court and counsel discuss that the information that Matthew Richardson is on Probation will be admissible.  As to the other witnesses, the Court finds that each of the convictions set forth in the Notice are relevant and admissible as to each witness.   The Court notes that ADA Hall has clarified that E. Wilson has nine prior convictions.  \n-------------------------------------\nThe Court hears arguments on the Defense Denny-Motion.   The Court will allow the Defense to introduce this evidence with witnesses Z. Johnson and E.
