Case called.  Appearances given.  \nMatthew R. Leusink appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\nDefendant Tyler T DeBaets in court, in custody with attorney Anthony N Flitcroft.  \nMatter is before the Court for hearing to determine how much credit the Defendant should receive on his sentences.  \nCourt asks if they have reached any agreement?\n10:07 am  Atty Flitcroft indicates he briefed the matter and also plugged the various dates into his program to calculate the number of days of credit.  \nCourt notes that it doesn't appear that Atty Flitcroft differentiated between the files based upon the Application for Jail Time Credit form on file from the Jail?\nResponse by Attorney Flitcroft to Court's question as to the sentence was structured and if would get credit on all files.  He believes Mr. DeBaets would be entitled to the same credit on files 2012CF000059 and 2013CF000411 since the sentences in those 2 cases are concurrent.  Attorney Luesink agrees with the 537 days of sentence credit calculated by Attorney Flitcroft and that it should apply to both of the Sentencing after revocation cases.  Parties also agree that Mr. DeBaets is not entitlted to any sentence credit in cases 2016CF000031 and 2016CM000045.\nJOC's in files 2012CF000059 and 2013CF000411 should reflect 537 days of sentence credit as agreed to by the parties.\nJOC's in files 2016CF000031 and 2016CM000045 should reflect -0- days of sentence credit as agreed to by the parties.  \n10:12 am  Court in recess.  \n","parties":[],"descr":"Hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000031-19","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2016-06-01","courtRptr":"Grzenia, Eileen"},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's Brief in Support of Dead Time Credit","parties":[],"descr":"Brief","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000031-20","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-05-18","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Assessment Report","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000031-18","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-05-16","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Dispositional order/judgment","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000031-17","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2016-05-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Plea questionnaire, waiver of rights","amount":null,"key":"64-2016CF000031-16","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2016-05-12","courtRptr":"Grzenia, Eileen"},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Tyler T DeBaets in court in custody with attorney Anthony N Flitcroft.
