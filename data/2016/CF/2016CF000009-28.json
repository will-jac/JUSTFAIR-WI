ADA Brookellen Teuber appears for the State of Wisconsin.\nAttorney Mcfadden raises an objection based on the Defense having first received the State's Witness List shortly before noon today.  Attorney McFadden seeks for the Court to impose the sanction of an exclusion of the testimony of the Defendant's wife. \nThe Court concludes that there has been a violation of the discovery rules due to the State not providing a witness list in response to the Defendant's demand for discovery . \nThe Court determines that precluding the witness would be an inappropriate, unnecessary sanction. \nThe Court rules on the Defense objections to the State's Notice of Intent to Admit Defendants Statements.  The Court finds that the statements are otherwise constitutionally admissible, and the Court concludes that the statements attributed to the Defendant through his wife are not otherwise prohibited under the husband-wife privilege. \nADA Teuber informs the Court and the Defense that the State no longer intends to present evidence of the statement that the Defendant made to social worker Rebecca Gregg.\n\nADA Teuber informs the Court that there is an issue with \"disc 2\" of the audio-recordings of the interview of Mr. Martinson with Detective Gary Curtis.  Attorney Mcfadden informed ADA Teuber today that he was not able to play one of the audiorecording-discs. When a replacement disc was provided today to Attorney Mcfadden, he could not open that disc either.   Attorney Mcfadden was able to listen to the recording in the DA's Office shortly before the hearing today. The State will continue its efforts to provide the Defense with a workable disc of the recording.  ADA Teuber confirms that the State intends to present the statements of the Defendant from both discs #1 and #2. \nAttorney Mcfadden requests ajdournment of the Jury Trial scheduled for later this week. \nThe Court concludes that in order for the Defense to be in a position that they have had an adequate opportunity to review the audiovisual recordings, adjournment of the Jury Trial is necessary. \nThe Court adjourns the Jury Trial. \nCounsel agree that this case should be set for a two-day trial length setting. \n\nThe Court requires the Defense to file any motion challenging statements in disc 2 on a constitutional basis no later than 10/14/16.\nIf such motion is filed, the State's response is to be filed by 10/21/16 \nThe Defense response to the State's filing, if any, is to be filed by 10/28/16.\n\nThe Court rules on the State's Motion to Impeach the Defendant with Prior Convictions:  The Court finds that all of Mr. Martinson's prior criminal convictions are status-type offenses and that they have little or no relation to honesty or credibility; they are misdemeanors and somewhat aged. When the Court combines this constellation of factors, the Court denies the State's Motion to Impeach the Defendant with prior convictions. \nrecess 3:48pm. \n\n\nNEXT:  (1) ADA Teuber is to draft the Scheduling Order and submit it by 9/30/16,  (2) Motion Hearing on 11/3/16 at 3:00pm--allow 30 minutes,  (3) FSSC on 11/7/16 at 3:00pm,  (4) Two Day Jury Trial on 11/10-11/11/16 at 8:30am\n\n","parties":[],"descr":"Hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000009-61","ctofc":"Wambach, David J.","date":"2016-09-19","courtRptr":"Gwidt, Rachel L"},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Eric J Martinson\nCurrent: W395N5826 Almar Dr, Oconomowoc, WI 53066 United States  (Effective: 09-19-2016)\nPrior: N7742 Vicksburg Way Unit F, Oconomowoc, WI 53066 United States\n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Martinson, Eric J"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000009-60","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Attorney McFadden's Enclosure letter with his 9/14/16 response and Proposed Jury Instruction filings","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000009-59","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-14","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's","parties":[],"descr":"Proposed jury instructions","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000009-58","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-14","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Response to State Motion: Husband-Wife Privilege","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000009-57","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-14","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Response to State Motion : Impeach with Prior Convictions","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000009-56","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-14","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Letter regarding the State's theory of admissibility as to statements.","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"28-2016CF000009-52","ctofc":"Wambach, David J.","date":"2016-09-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Case called at 2:31pm [MA]\nDefendant Eric J Martinson in court with attorney Bryant J Mcfadden.
