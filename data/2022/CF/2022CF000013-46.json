Attorney Jon D. Seifert appeared by phone for State of Wisconsin.  Attorney Zebulon Patek appeared by video for David Allen Katusky.  Mr. Katusky will enter into a Guilty or No Contest plea on count 1 for 3 year DAGP contract.  He will plead to count 2 and count 3 and costs of case, 2 years probation and parties argue jail.  He has 5 days jail credit.  DAGPA has been provided to counsel.  Attorney Patek confirms accurate statement, filed a PLQ & copy of the electronically signed DAGP agreement.  State confirms victim rights have been complied with.  Court advises of count 1 in the Information/max. penalties with a domestic abuse assessment.  Court reviews conditions of the contract with defendant; advises of count 2/max. penalties; count 3/max. penalties; advised of constitutional rights he will be giving up and rights to appear personally.  Defendant agrees to conduct this hearing in this fashion.  Mr. Patek stipulates the complaints provided the factual basis for plea.  Court finds defendant KVI waives his constitutional rights and factual basis for pleas.  To count 1, defendant pleads guilty.  Court defers accepting his plea for 3 years.  To count 2 and count 3, defendant pleads guilty.  Court accepts your plea to count 2 & 3 and find him guilty.  State notes Mr. Katusky has a noteable criminal history and in count 2 and 3, 2 yrs. probation, jail as condition think 50 days jail  on battery, 10 days on the disorderly to run concurrent.  Atty Patek asks for 45 days conditional jail stayed.  Treatment in community by probation makes the most sense and to protect the public.  State cited a criminal history but he hasn't had much since 2012 except for the more recently.  We request a finding of huber eligibility since Mr. Katusky has F/T employment.  Mr. Seifert, the body of the complaint reads as follows:  read on the record.  Has the victim declined to prosecute in the past?  Yes. This is the first actual prosecution of more than one domestic abuse with this victim?  Yes, It's a complicated circumstance relative to the victim.  Mr. Katusky contests there was prior domestic abuse with eachother.  The DA suggested otherwise.  Mr. Seifert indicates the officer may be referring to other offenses he was arrested for and the State declined to prosecute.  My staff informed me there was separate victim, a different person in 2018 must be the reference the officer was making.  Mr. Katusky was arrested?  Yes, in Durand.  Off the record for breakout room at 1:20 PM.  Back on record 1:24 PM.  Atty Patek was unable to find any information about an arrest back in 2018, don't seem to ever been charges filed in that matter and that 2018 case is not relevant to cases today.  Court: Mr. Katusky told the Court he had never been arrested and DA Seifert had direct evidence of the contrary from the 2018 incident.  That informs this court that the public needs protection from Mr. Katusky.   Mr. Katusky rehabilitated needs are significant.  Probation will be the disposition. It's a vicious crime.  Mr. Katusky doesn't appear to have remorse about this matter.  Court withholds sentence on both battery and DC and place on concurrent 2 year probationary terms.  Conditions of probation:  I will not put any jail on DC, put 120 days jail on the battery as conditional jail.  Court will have significant amount of jail time to work with if there are violations.  Be aware of the terms of the DAGPA, probable cause for arrest, the DA would have the option to ask to revoke the contract.  You could be sentenced to up to 6 years in prison without trial. Order you as a condition of probation attend a batters treatment class program and complete it; No possession or consumption of alcohol; No possession or consumption of a controlled substance without a prescription and if have a physician's prescription, take it within therapeutic range;  submit to mental health assessment selected by DOC.  Somewhere, something triggers violence and we need to find out what it is.  AODA and follow the requirements.  If you are in a treatment program, good for you.  Pay court costs on a schedule set by PO agent.  If RAL is in need of therapy or treatment, you will pay for it.  Mr. Seifert's VWC will find that out.  Report to the Pepin Co. Probation Office no later than close of business tomorrow.  Bond be applied to $443 on each charge with balance ret'd to person who posted it.  Advised of appeal rights.  Report to the PCJ, 30 days to report.  Mr. Seifert you did not mentioned any contact with RAL.  That was done on purpose, there was no request, there was a request not to do so.  We will heard to the wishes as RAL in that regard.

Given the nature and seriousness of this matter think cash bond appropriate for the Court to consider and ask $1000 cash bond with victim no contact with victim RAL, place of abode or employment; no possession of alcohol.  At the time of booking on this arrest his blood alchol test was a .248.   Defendant informs he has an alcohol assessment set up and will be starting a job on 4/11 and looking to seek treatment asap.  Mr. Seifert reported a failure to appear in court and this is a highly serious allegation would increase the possibility of light making you a risk and the Court will impose $1000 cash bond proposed by the District Attorney.  If you pay that bond, require no contact in any form either electronically, by phone or mail with RAL and refrain from possessing and consuming alcohol and entering bars or taverns.  Mr. Katusky addressed bond; does not want to lose the change to get this job and is not a flight risk.  The court would be willing to entertain the idea of inpatient treatment as an idea.  Your record makes you a flight risk as well as these charges.  Court urges you to contact the PD office or an attorney of your choice.
