Defendant Richard Irving Boatman in court with attorneys Gabriel Andres Pollak and Richard Jones Sr.  Defendant in custody.  James Jay Rennicke appeared for State of Wisconsin.  Case 22CF103 is on for preliminary hearing.  State calls first witness, Detective Patrick Carlson, who is sworn in and testifies.  Witness has identified the defendant.  Venue is made.  Atty Jones crosses.  DA redirects.  State rests, asks for bindover.  Defense objects to bindover, without argument.  Court finds probable cause that a crime has been committed and the defendant probably committed it.  The matter is bound over for further proceedings.  The State files information, which deviates from complaint (provides basis for corrections to charges).  Defense is aware of the deviations and proceed to arraignment.  Case proceeds to Arraignment.  Defendant acknowledges receipt of information, def. waives reading.  Court informs def. of charges, possible penalties and rights.  NG plea entered to all counts.  Atty Jones requests 30 days beyond receiving discovery (45 days).  Court extends time to file motions to next STC date.  Court will allow Atty Jones to appear to STCs by video.  Case proceeds to bond motion hearing, atty Pollak enters supplemental argument to motion.  State argues against bond modification, if modified, asks for additional conditions- no weapons, have law enforcement clear the home of any weapons, no contact w/victims, no leaving state without prior authorization, absolute sobriety, curfew, no use/possession of substances or paraphernalia, regular check-ins with law enforcement.  Atty Jones does not object to the proposed conditions.  Court takes judicial notice of cases involving def's mother.  Court denies the bond modification.
