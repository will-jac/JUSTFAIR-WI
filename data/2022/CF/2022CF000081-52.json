Scott in court.  Attorney Amy Elizabeth Forehand in court for State of Wisconsin. Attorney Jeremiah Wolfgang Meyer-O'Day in court for Jonathan R. Scott. Atty. M-O argues for modification of bond, presently cash; there's also a non-monetary condition that the Def remain outside of Richland County. Defense argues that Def currently resides in Plain, outside of Richland County and that the Def has no issue residing outside of Richland County; Defense argues, however, that, being prohibited from being within Richland County is a constitutional violation of his right to travel; additionally, Def's work requires him to travel and it is inconvenient for him to do his work, having to avoid any travel in Richland County. Atty. Forehand argues the State's position; asserts that cash is appropriate in this case and the statute provides for the conditions set to allow for the safety of the victim; notes the allegations in the case which includes threats made by the Def to persons within Richland County; State believes there needs to be some radius within the victim's home so that Def not come into contact and suggests within 5 mile radius of the victim's residence. Court notes there are 2 victims listed. State asks for the 5-mile radius which would cover both victims' residence locations. Defense argues for a 1-mile radius prohibition. Court modifies bond conditions so that the Def must stay out of the Town of Orion and any thoroughfares through there as well as the Village of Muscoda (the village itself and any routes going through it), continuing to have no contact with the victims or their residence.
