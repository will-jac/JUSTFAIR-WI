If the court makes a decision in a case that a\n    party disagrees with, the party may have the right to seek review by a\n    higher court to determine if the trial court's decision was correct.\n    Appeals are most often made after a trial or final decision in a case, but\n    an appeal can also occur before a final decision.\n  </p><p data-section-name=\"notice\">\n    <strong>Notice to employers:</strong> It may be a violation of state law to\n    discriminate against a job applicant because of an arrest or conviction\n    record.
