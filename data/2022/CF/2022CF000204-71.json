Attorney David R. Knaapen in court for State of Wisconsin.  Attorney Gary J. Kryshak in court for Calliston J Stimac. \nScott Killian is sworn as a witness and questioned by Attorney Knaapen. He is a police officer with the Wisconsin Rapids Police Department. On 4/30/22, he was dispatched to the Baker Street IGA regarding a retail theft. Officer Zaleski was outside and he was inside talking to employees. Officer Zaleski observed a vehicle leave and go across the street. He followed the vehicle and the defendant was the driver of the vehicle. The witness identifies the defendant in the courtroom. They observed the aluminum foil that was taken from the store and they searched the vehicle and the defendant. He found a cut straw and a gem baggie. They found a bindle on the defendant and it tested positive for opiates. Other bindles of opiates were found in the vehicle. Based on the way the bindles were packaged and the weight, he feels it was intended to be delivered. Defendant was on bond on another case at the time of this incident. Attorney Kryshak cross-examines witness.  \nCourt finds probable cause that a felony was committed and the defendant committed it. Not guilty plea to all counts. Attorney Kryshak withdraws motion for bond modification.
