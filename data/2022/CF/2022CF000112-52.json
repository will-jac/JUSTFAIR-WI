Burdick moves for a brief furlough with bond to state that relatives present ID at the jail for Def's release for specific times (and return for specific time). Atty. Forehand asks where the services are. Def does not have the details; his family has them. He provides the name of the deceased; Atty. Forehand tries to locate the obituary for confirmation of the service date, time, and location; without that, State does not have enough information to make a recommendation but is not objecting to the furlough. Defense is asking for release from Wednesday to Friday. Court does not believe it is necessary for a furlough from Wednesday to Friday as Def has indicated his father, who is local, will be picking him up; Court is willing to allow a furlough for Thursday.

Court grants the furlough starting Wednesday at 6 p.m. until Friday at 8 a.m. Def may be at his father's residence or en route or back from the funeral, attending the service or whatever reception there is, meaning that he return to his father's residence immediately after the service, pending return to the jail.
