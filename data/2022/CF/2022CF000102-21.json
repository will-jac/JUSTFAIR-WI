State recites agreement, defendant would guilty plea to counts 1, 5, 9, 10, 11 and 12 as alleged. Counts 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 will be DRI. State joint recommendation  on counts 9, 10, 11 and 12 - 5 year sentence, 2 years of initial confinement with 3 years of extended supervision, concurrent to each other. Court concerned with count 9, does not believe that sentence is appropriate.
