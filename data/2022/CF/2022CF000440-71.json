Attorney Robert John Kaiser Jr in court for State of Wisconsin.  Attorney Edward Minser in court for State of Wisconsin. \nCourt reviews what has happened so far in the case. The Public Defender has not determined his eligibility for Counsel as defendant will not meet with him. Transport was sent to Racine Correctional, but defendant refused to come out of his cell and be transported. He is currently in his cell and a video is set up in front of his cell. Court will proceed with preliminary hearing today.  \nDavid Bailey is sworn as a witness and questioned by Attorney Kaiser. He is a detective with the Wisconsin Rapids Police Department. Exhibit #1, Criminal Complaint, is marked and reviewed with witness and received. He testifies as to the murder on 7/17/2005. He reviews the 911 call. Victim's wife was present in the home. A knife was missing from the kitchen. Victim was pronounced deceased in the bedroom. The autopsy showed a 4 1/2 stab wound which pierced his lungs. The manner of death was homicide. He has met with defendant in prison.  He believes the person in the cell is the defendant.  He spoke to the garbage disposal person who indicated that the garbage was picked up at 11:00 a.m. on Wednesdays, and July 17 was a Wednesday. Defendant indicated that he had a sexual relationship with victim's wife. Victim's wife initially denied it, but later admitted to it after defendant admitted to it.  Defendant was in the jail in 2012 and admitted to other inmates that he had stabbed victim. He told them at he had disposed of the murder weapon and his clothes and it was taken by the garbage truck that morning. On 5/5/22, he spoke to an inmate at Racine Correctional Institution when they were in a holding cell together and defendant told him that he committed a homicide in the 1980's and he was having an affair with the victim's wife. He told him that he put the knife in the garbage and was taken by the garbage truck that morning. He testifies as to other things the inmate told him that he knows are true.\nCourt finds probable cause that a felony was committed and the defendant committed it.  Arraignment will be held at a later date. Bond is continued.","parties":[],"descr":"Preliminary hearing and Arraignment","amount":null,"key":"71-2022CF000440-19","ctofc":"Wolf, Todd P","date":"2022-09-19","courtRptr":"Peterson, Michelle"},{"addlTxt":"SPD Appointment of Counsel Report","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"71-2022CF000440-18","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Electronic Notice Update","amount":null,"key":"71-2022CF000440-17","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-16","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Subpoena Duces Tecum; Complaint for Subpoena; Return of Officer","parties":[],"descr":"Subpoena","amount":null,"key":"71-2022CF000440-16","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Detainer Acknowledgement (Refused to Sign)","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"71-2022CF000440-15","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Bench Brief Regarding Presence of Defendant","parties":[],"descr":"Brief","amount":null,"key":"71-2022CF000440-14","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Initial appearance on September 19, 2022 at 02:45 pm.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"71-2022CF000440-13","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Writ of Habeas Corpus Ad Prosequendum","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"71-2022CF000440-12","ctofc":"Wolf, Todd P","date":"2022-09-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Writ of Habeas Corpus","parties":[],"descr":"Proposed Order","amount":null,"key":"71-2022CF000440-11","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Preliminary hearing and Arraignment on September 19, 2022 at 02:45 pm.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"71-2022CF000440-10","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Donald Wayne Maier\nCurrent: PO Box 900, Racine Correctional Institution 279542, Sturtevant, WI 53177 United States  (Effective: 09-09-2022)\nPrior: Racine Correctional Institution, PO Box 900, Sturtevant, WI 53177-0900 US\n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Maier, Donald Wayne"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"71-2022CF000440-9","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"No contact w/ any witnesses in the case.","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Maier, Donald Wayne"}],"descr":"Cash bond set","amount":100000.00,"key":"71-2022CF000440-8","ctofc":"Brazeau, Nicholas J., Jr.","date":"2022-09-09","courtRptr":"Zamow, Denise"},{"addlTxt":"1:36 PM Attorney Robert John Kaiser Jr in court for State of Wisconsin.
