Defendant Alexander Y Gallatin appeared by Zoom video, in custody at Mendota.  Attorney Ricardo Tapia in court for Alexander Y Gallatin.  Prosecuting attorney Chelsea Thompson in court for the State of Wisconsin. All parties have agreed that some may have the hearing conducted remotely. This hearing has met the statutory standards for video conferencing. Court notes it has received a copy of the competency report from Milwaukee County and notes that all counsel have agreed to use the findings in that report for this matter.  State confirms they have agreed to use the competency report from Milwaukee County and do not contest the findings.  State also notes in the Milwaukee County case there is an order for involuntary administration of medication and is requesting that order also be put in place in this matter as well.  Atty. Tapia confirms he will accept the findings in the Milwaukee County competency report and is not contesting the findings.  Based on there being no contest and based on the findings in the Competency report from Milwaukee County dated 08/15/2022 the Court will find the defendant is not competent to proceed but likely to become competent with treatment.  Court orders the proceedings be suspended and defendant is committed to the Department of Health Services. Court will also order involuntary administration of medications.  Court believes the matter should be adjourned about 90 days out for status.  Atty. Tapia responds and is asking the matter be set for a date shortly after the updated report in the defendant's Milwaukee County cases is due.  No objection by State for matter to be set in about 30 days, which is the return for the updated report from Milwaukee Co.  Court will schedule the matter about 45 days out noting if the matter needs to be set for a sooner date based on the findings in the Milwaukee Co. case the Court can do so.
