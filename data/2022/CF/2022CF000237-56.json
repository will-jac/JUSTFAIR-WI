Defendant Christopher Lee Martinez in court, in custody.  Attorney Jesse Lee Leichsenring and Atty Allison Markoski in court for Christopher Lee Martinez.  Court states cases and appearances.  Court notes matter is set for a plea hearing today.  Atty Markoski is moving to withdraw on 22CF128 and 22CF214 and 22CF237 at the DE's request and new counsel would be appointed by the PD's office.  DE is in agreement.  Court questions DE on his understanding and notes those 3 matters are/will be set for PH in August.  Court will allow Atty Markoski to withdraw in those 3 cases and new counsel to be appointed.  22CF214 will be added for a PH on 8/18/22 at 9:30 a.m. to track with 22CF128 and 22CF237.  Court questions Atty Leichsenring on status of his cases noting 22CF39 still needs a PH.  Atty Leichsenring notes he will be filing a motion to withdraw as well noting one of the cases is set for trial in 9 days.  Court notes that's a Br 1 case.  Court explains why all matters were set in her Branch as she has the oldest felony but notes each branch has some of these cases.  State notes all 22CF cases still need a PH so asks that all those be kicked back to the right branch for PH.  21CF130 is set for a JT in Br 1 in 9 days.  State notes there may also be some more criminal charges coming down the pipe.  Court will focus on the Br 2 matters only - 22CF39.  Court will have that matter set for PH but unsure about when to set it for.  State would agree to have all 4 matters set for PH at the same date/time - 8/18/2022.  Court orders PH set in 22CF39 at 9:30 and blocks off 9:45 also.  Court won't take any action on the motions to withdraw as each branch will need to address those as well as scheduling on an individual basis.  Atty Markoski notes she has filed a motion to modify bond but the Court won't hear it as she's been allowed to withdraw.  That motion can be addressed once new counsel is appointed.  State agrees.","parties":[],"descr":"Hearing","amount":null,"key":"56-2022CF000237-14","ctofc":"Klicko, Wendy J.
