Count 1 alleges acceptance of a down payment without a written contract, but the complaint establishes that the payment was made after the work was completed. Count 2 alleges theft by misrepresentation, but the specific misrepresentation is not clear. Is it the original verbal estimate or perhaps a claim that the presented bill misrepresented the fair value of 200 gallons of material? Either way, the victim was aware that the verbal estimate was incorrect and was aware of what the defendants were billing and their reasons at the time of tendering payment. The complaint certainly alleges that the unit cost of the sealant was grossly higher than with another vendor, but billing at a exorbitant price doesn't establish a misrepresentation existing at the time of payment.","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Collins, Paul, Jr"}],"descr":"Authorized Warrant Not Issued","amount":null,"key":"13-2022CF002251-5","ctofc":"Hanson, Jason","date":"2022-08-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Collins, Paul, Jr"}],"descr":"Arrest warrant authorized","amount":0.00,"key":"13-2022CF002251-4","ctofc":"Hanson, Jason","date":"2022-08-26","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Electronic Filing Notice","amount":null,"key":"13-2022CF002251-3","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-08-26","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Case initiated by electronic filing","amount":null,"key":"13-2022CF002251-2","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-08-26","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Complaint filed","amount":null,"key":"13-2022CF002251-1","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-08-26","courtRptr":null}],"prosAgency":"District Attorney","citations":[],"defAttys":[],"balanceDue":0,"allowPurchase":false},"view":{"caseNo":{"value":"2022CF002251"},"countyNo":{"value":13}}}
