He would be staying with the mens pastor at his church.  He can get a ride from anyone from his church or pay.  He can come up with $250. \n\nBY THE COURT: \nDefendant is facing a 4th offense OWI after having been charged with a 3rd offense only a few days prior. \nCourt finds the bond that was previously posted was fair, but he has not been able to post that. \nCourt modifies the bond to require the defendant to pay $250 up front and pay $100 each month after that with the final payment of $50 until $1,000 has been posted.\nConditions as originally stated will continue with the added condition of no operation of a motor vehicle. \n\nCourt questions the defendant as to what hours he would be working. \nDefendant states he would be late shift at Superior or any hours he can work at Rocky's. \n\nBY THE COURT: \nThe defendant is to be home by 7 p.m. except if he is working, then he can be at work or going directly to or from work. \n\nDefendant states he understands those conditions and asks if church would be allowed after 7 p.m. \nCourt questions the defendant. \nDefendant states there are night services and a mens group. \n\nBY THE COURT: \nCurfew will now be 9:30 p.m. - 7:00 a.m. aside from work. \n\nAtty Weiland addresses the defendant to provide him and the court with any updated addresses and phone numbers so he can stay in contact.  \n\nCourt questions if the pre-trial conference has been done. \nAtty Weiland makes statements, they have but he needs to be able to speak to his client.
