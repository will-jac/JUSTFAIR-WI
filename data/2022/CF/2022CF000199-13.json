Prosecuting Atty Paul W. Humphrey appeared for State of Wisconsin. Attorney Paul W. Humphrey in court for Plaintiff State of Wisconsin.  Interpreter Jim Larson sworn. Court speaks to case, SPD is still searching for an attorney for Mr. Alvarez.  ADA has also reached out to SPD, spoke with Atty. Dorl about trying to move him to the top of the list due to him being in custody solely on this case.  They have stated he is on the list, and has to wait.  Court is not allowed to set cash bail on this case, and he is entitled to have an attorney present for these hearing. The statue also instructs reasonable time to commence the action. Court is concerned about him remaining in custody. ADA Humphrey: the statue does not give time limits. He knows of cases in the extradition world, where it is generally a few days. Two things in conflict, needs a layer for Habeas corpus, or to address the warrant.  CT: what would happen if he waived it, not stating that he has or does. ADA: he would remain in custody under the warrant.  CT: would they take him back before the WI cases were resolved?  ADA: they would hold him on the warrant.  CT: asking ADA to reach out to LA, and find out if they would continue to hold him under the warrant even with the pending WI cases.  ADA: will contact LA, and write the Court.  CT: doesn't believe there is any legal grounds on us asking LA this, but with him being held solely on waiting for an attorney.  Court will set another status, to see if we have gained any ground. ADA: suggest if he has a family member locally or in LA to reach out to his probation agent down there, that may be helpful.  Mr. Alvarez: did speak to an attorney in LA, and he could work from there.  CT: that attorney would have to be licensed in the state of WI in order for that to work.  CT: if he has funds to retain an attorney privately here, that may help in this case. Mr. Alvarez: with not working, he doesn't have any funds.  CT: not able to let him out on bail on this case, the statue does not permit the Court to do so.  Mr. Alvarez: he would like to resolve his cases here, he states he paid a fine of $1,000 in LA.
