He responded to a house fire on 5/26/22 in the Village of Port Edwards.  He obtained a search warrant for the residence due to possible controlled substances. The fire department did a sweep of the residence for hot spots and they reported a large bag of green vegetable like material.  He instructed Sgt. Berry to retrieve any items that might be evidence so the fire would not destroy them. The substance was tested and tested positive for THC. A brown powdery substance was found and tested positive for methamphetamine. A white powdery substance was found and it tested positive for cocaine. The THC weighed 511 grams and $6,000 was seized from the residence. Based on his training and experience, he feels that the substances were intended to be distributed. Defendant was present at the residence on that day. The witness identifies the defendant in the courtroom.
