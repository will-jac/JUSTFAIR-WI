Attorney Jon D. Seifert appeared by phone for State of Wisconsin. Court advised defendant of charges in criminal complaint/max. penalties and rights.  Mr. Seifert - Mr. Johnson lives in MN but has significant actions of criminal law as of recent, convicted felon, on 2 deferred agreements from Eau Claire County, Misd. convictions in Clark Co.  Understand in Buffalo Co. recently concluded a # of cases and a # of related charges that were DRI.  He's on a Probation hold.  State believes he is a flight risk and ask cash bond $2500.00.  Mr. Johnson doesn't believe all that is correct, only on 1 deferred in Eau Claire, just got on probation and cooperating with Pepin County, ask cash bond reduced or signature bond.  Because you are on a probation hold at this time, Court impose a cash bond and reason why is you get credit for time spent in jail on a hold.  If I give you a signature bond, you can't do that.  Court will consider a request for signature bond if appropriate.  Court urges you to contact the PD office and discuss a PH in this matter.  The next hearing will be by zoom if in jail, if not, in person.\nAdjourned initial appearance scheduled for September 20, 2022 at 01:30 pm.","parties":[],"descr":"Initial appearance","amount":null,"key":"46-2022CF000035-5","ctofc":"Clark, Thomas W.","date":"2022-09-15","courtRptr":"Henthorn, Ashley"},{"addlTxt":"Adjourned initial appearance on September 20, 2022 at 01:30 pm.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"46-2022CF000035-4","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Electronic Filing Notice","amount":null,"key":"46-2022CF000035-3","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Case initiated by electronic filing","amount":null,"key":"46-2022CF000035-2","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Complaint filed","amount":null,"key":"46-2022CF000035-1","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-09-15","courtRptr":null}],"prosAgency":"District Attorney","citations":[],"defAttys":[{"name":"Schroeder, Nicholis J"}],"balanceDue":0,"allowPurchase":false},"view":{"caseNo":{"value":"2022CF000035"},"countyNo":{"value":46}}}
