They will continue looking for counsel. Court will proceed with preliminary hearing today. \nNicholas Brockman is sworn as a witness and questioned by Attorney Lambert. He is a police officer with the Wisconsin Rapids Police Department. On 8/16/22, he was dispatched to a verbal altercation in the City of Wisconsin Rapids. In route, he was advised that parties were leaving in a vehicle. He located the vehicle and two people were in the vehicle. The witness identifies the defendant in the courtroom as the driver of the vehicle. A bag of THC was found in the vehicle and a bag with crystal like material and drug paraphernalia was also found. The female in the vehicle indicated that the drugs belonged to defendant. Defendant was transported to the jail by Officer Jazdzewski. There was white crystal like material found in the squad car where defendant was sitting. The substance was falling out of his pants. When he was booked into the jail, more bags of crystal like material were found on defendant. The substances tested positive for methamphetamine, Fentanyl and THC.  Because of the amount of substances found, he feels it was intended to be distributed. Attorney Lambert asks Court to take judicial notice of Portage County case 14CF8, a prior drug conviction. Court takes judicial notice.\nCourt finds probable cause that a felony was committed and the defendant committed it. Bound over for further proceedings.
