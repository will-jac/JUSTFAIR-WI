Attorney Michael Edward Covey in court for Joseph R Huddleston.  Attorney Jennifer M. Harper in court for State of Wisconsin. VWS also appeared. \n\n22CF1 - Arraignment held, information on file. Atty. Covey addresses the Court - Defense waives reading of the information; it has been reviewed by the Def and Atty. Covey. Court states the charges and informs Def of the max. penalties. DA Harper confirms compliance with Ch 950. To all 20 counts of the information, NG pleas entered by the Defense. DA Harper informs the Court that the parties have an agreement whereby Def will change his pleas to Count 1 and 2; State will request a PSI; Defense has indicated they will request an alternate PSI; State is dismissing and reading in 22CF84; State is not referring this matter to the feds but makes no representation on what the feds may do with matter of manufacturing child pornography. Atty. Covey - Defense concedes it is aware the fed government is not bound by any agreement; notes Defense will be having a psychosexual evaluation done rather than an alternate PSI and expects that to take at least 6 weeks; Defense will provide that eval to the State once received.\n\n22CF84 - Court notes an initial had not been done prior to today. Noting that matter is recommended for DRI, Court calls and completes the initial appearance in this matter, stating the charges and informing the Def of the max. penalties including child porn surcharges. State motions to dismiss and read in this case. Court so orders. 22CF84 DRI for purposes of sentencing in 22CF1.\n\n22CF1 - Def pleads guilty to counts 1 and 2/repeated sexual assault of a child. Court's colloquy with Def. Atty. Covey confirms this was the sole, negotiated offer; it has been thoroughly reviewed and considered by the Defense. Defense concedes factual basis. Court accepts Def's guilty pleas and will enter judgment accordingly. At this time, sentencing deferred for completion of a PSI. State asks sentencing be held in early to mid-February. Defense asks for late January or early March due to counsel's work in a three-week trial. Court sets 3/17 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. State plans to call expert; Defense asks for disclosure of said witness. 3/1 set as deadline for that exchange. \n\nCounts 3-20 DRI in 22CF1.
