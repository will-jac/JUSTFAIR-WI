If it is not approved, then there would be a hearing on that. \nCourt questions if the state is requesting a pre-sentence investigation (PSI). \nAtty Pfeil indicates the state is not asking for one but does not object if defense requests one. \nAttorney for defendant concurs with agreement stated.  \n\nCourt questions Atty Pfeil with regards to the amended information and statute 943.01(2)(d). \nAtty Bergner agrees. \nDefendant received copy of the amended information.\nDefendant waives reading of the amended information. \n\nDefendant enters a plea of: \n22CF81 Count 1 - NO CONTEST\n22CF52 Count 1 - NO CONTEST\n21CF484 Count 1 - NO CONTEST\n\nCourt questions defendant regarding plea questionnaire, waiver of constitutional rights and understandings.\nDefendant agrees he has been convicted of a felony prior to this date. \nCourt advises defendant of elements the state must prove for the charge.\nCourt questions attorney for the defendant.\nCourt finds defendant's plea is freely, voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made.\nAttorneys stipulate that there is factual basis for the charge(s).\n\nBY THE COURT:\nCourt finds a sufficient factual basis to support the charge(s).\nCourt finds the defendant guilty of the following:\n22CF81 Count 1 - Felony criminal damage as a repeater 943.01(2)(d) & 939.62(1)(b)\n22CF52 Count 1 - Possession of firearm by a felony 941.29(1m)(a)\n21CF484 Count 1 - Drive or operate motor vehicle without owners consent 943.23\nClerk directed to enter judgment of conviction(s) this date.\nCourt finds the defendant does hold the repeater status.  \n\nCourt questions parties regarding PSI request. \nNeither party are requesting a PSI. \nCourt questions if the parties are able to provide enough information to the court. \nAtty Bergner states he filed a sentencing memorandum and therefore they will not be requesting that.
