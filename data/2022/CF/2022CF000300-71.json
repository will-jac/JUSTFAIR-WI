Attorney David R. Knaapen in court for State of Wisconsin.  Attorney Travis S Slattery in court for Raymond M Hines. \nSeth Thome is sworn as a witness and questioned by Attorney Knaapen. He is a police officer with the Grand Rapids Police Department. On 6/17/22, he was dispatched to a resident in the Town of Grand Rapids regarding a possible robbery. When he arrived, he observed a male and female walking away from the residence. He identified the defendant and he observed a wooden knife handle sticking out of his pant's pocket. The witness identifies the defendant in the courtroom. He learned that defendant was on probation and he notified Probation & Parole. Probation & Parole requested defendant be put on a probation hold, so he took him into custody. While defendant was being booked into the jail, a baggie with a white substance in it fell out of defendant's clothing. The substance was tested and it tested positive for methamphetamine. Attorney Slattery cross-examines witness.  \nCourt finds probable cause that a felony was committed and the defendant committed it. Not guilty plea.
