Mr. Hillestad & I have resolved this matter as well as 22CF19.  A PLQ/WRF has been signed and filed by Mr. Wulff and Mr. Hillestad.  Mr. Wulff will enter a plea to count 1 of a Second Amended Information  948.02(1)(e) Class B felony.  If he pleads, state would move to dismiss counts 2 & 3 in that case 21CF40 and also State would move to dismiss all counts in 22CF19 companion case.  The PLQ sets forth negotiations.    Both parties will ask to delay sentencing and take the plea today.  Court reviews elements of what State is moving to amend count 1 to 948.02(1)(e) with max. penalty; reviews constitutional rights with defendant; felony prohibitions.  Defendant has no questions and have had sufficient time to consider this agreement and is satisfied with Mr. Hillestad's service in this matter.  Atty Hillestad stipulates criminal complaint contains sufficient facts for his plea.  Court finds State has met its burden to victim rights.  To the amended charge with sexual contact or sexual intercourse with child not obtaining the age of 16, defendant pleads no contest.  Court accepts your plea 948.02(1)(e) to count 1 in 21CF40.
