Svehlek agrees, filed RFS on Friday, 10/7/22. Court advises parties that he did not see the RFS until this morning as it was filed late Friday afternoon. Court finds the RFS was filed timely and in proper form, does want to address bond and makes statements as it relates to the defendant's past appearance and demeanor in Court. Court - 969.08(2) - can consider bond adjustments - has reviewed the defendant's criminal history as was not advised of that at the time that bond originally set and finds the defendant has a significant criminal history - the filing of RFS does not excuse his presence for today - sets bond at $5,000.00 cash with no consumption of alcohol, must sign and return to Clerk of Court within 10 days - if not paid by the end of today, Court will issue a bench warrant for his arrest. State asks for conditions of no entry into any bars or taverns and no use or possession of THC or any derivatives of THC. Discussion on no contact with victim. Court will add those conditions, does grant the RFS, Ms. Svehlek's motion to withdraw would have to be filed when a new Judge is assigned if that is still her intent. Svehlek asks for bond to resemble his other bonds in other counties at this time, $3500.00 cash, would normally ask for $500.00 cash.
