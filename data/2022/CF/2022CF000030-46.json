Attorney Jon D. Seifert, DA for Pepin Co. appeared by phone for State of Wisconsin. Karen Interpreter Karen Naw appeared by video means.  Interpreter makes contact with defendant. Defendant understands interpreter.  Court advises defendant of charges in criminal complaint/max. penalties and because the offense occurred within 1000 feet of the Pepin County Jail, the Court shall impose 100 hours of community service work for a public agency or a nonprofit charitable organization. Court advises defendant of his constitutional rights.  Mr. Seifert addresses bond.  Mr. Soe is a resident of MN and has limited contact with Pepin Co., also has a limited criminal history and record shows no incidents of FTA for court appearances, therefore the State requests a signature bond of $1000.00.  Conditions:  no possession or consumption of controlled substances; no operation of MV w/o valid license.  Mr. Kohler has no objection to the State's request for bond.  Court sets $1000 signature bond with conditions:  No possession or consumption of controlled substances without a prescription; No operation of MV without a valid drivers license or insurance.   Defendant has a question regarding getting things from his car.  Court, if it is not seized for evidence.  If they will not release your car, contact Mr. Kohler with the WI SPD and you can get that phone # from the Pepin Co. Clerk of Court.  State has information for the Court.  Law enforcement has not impounded Mr. Soe's vehicle for evidentiary purpose, however, it was towed from the scene and he will have to pay the tow bill to release it.  His record shows he has a pending matter in MN that resulted in the administrative suspension of his operating privileges.  Court repeats the bond conditions to Mr. Soe:  Do not drive without a valid driver's license and do not drive without insurance.  If you get caught driving without a D/L or insurance that could be a new crime.  Defendant has no questions.  Next hearing Mr. Soe may appear by zoom if no objection by his attorney.
