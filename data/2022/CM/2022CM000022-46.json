If you can follow those terms of the agreement, then at the end, the matter would be dismissed.   If you fail to do so the state would have the option to ask me to revoke the agreement, accept your plea and we will proceed to sentencing without trial based on your plea.  Court reviews constitutional rights with defendant.  Mr. Raymond satisfied factual basis within the complaint.  Court finds KVI waiving constitutional rights and there is a factual basis for plea.  Defendant pleads guilty to count 2.  Court defers acceptance for a period of 1 year and approve the contract.  DRI count 1.  State has complied with victim rights with no response from one victim and the other victim was supportive of the agreement.
