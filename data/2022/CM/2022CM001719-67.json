Defendant Levi W Geisness in court.  Attorney Bryant J Mcfadden in court for Levi W Geisness.  Prosecuting attorney Chelsea Thompson in court for the State of Wisconsin. Court notes the matter is before the court with respect to Defense Motion to Modify Bail.  State advises they have no objection to the request to lift the no contact order with respect to Victims A-C and Witnesses A-D, but they are asking there be a no contact order with respect to Victim D and Witness E as it relates to the Amended Complaint that was filed back on 10/1.  Atty. McFadden acknowledges receipt, waives reading and enters initial not guilty plea to the Amended Complaint filed on 10/1/22.  State would like to amend its initial statement, as she miss read the notes from the ADA assigned to the case.  State advises that the request is made by the Victims and Witnesses themselves, the State does not agree with lifting the no contact order.  Atty. McFadden presents additional statements.  Court confirms with the Victims and Witnesses present in court today that they are asking to have the no contact order be lifted.  For reasons placed on the record the Court will grant the Defendant's Motion to Modify Bail conditions as follows:  Court will lift the no contact order with respect to Victims A-C and Witnesses A-D, but court will add a no contact order with respect to Victim D and Witness E only.  All other conditions will remain as previously set.  Court inquires as to the status of the case.  Atty. McFadden provides an update; he is still waiting for some digital discovery, and is ok with keeping the currently scheduled further proceedings set for 10/28.  State confirms several pieces of digital discovery were requested but their office has not received them yet.  Court will reschedule the 10/28/2022 hearing to middle of November to allow the State some addition time to work on obtaining the digital discovery.\nHearing scheduled for November 17, 2022 at 02:00 pm.","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Geisness, Levi W"}],"descr":"Bail/bond hearing","amount":null,"key":"67-2022CM001719-22","ctofc":"Moroney, Dennis P.","date":"2022-10-17","courtRptr":"Brushaber, Samantha"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Amended complaint","amount":null,"key":"67-2022CM001719-21","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-10-10","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion and Order to Seal Victim/Witness Identification Key signed by Judge Paul F Reilly October 7, 2022.","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"67-2022CM001719-20","ctofc":"Reilly, Paul","date":"2022-10-07","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's Notice of Motion and Motion to Modify Conditions of Bond filed by Attorney Bryant J.
