Herbers provides an update; he notes the offer is contingent on his client completing an AODA assessment, his client needs additional time to complete that.  Atty. Herbers is asking the matter be removed form the trial calendar and set for plea and sentencing the week on October 10th.  Atty. Thompson notes the State is prepared to proceed to trial next week, but notes they did provide an updated offer to defense counsel Sunday so they have no objection to defense's request.  Court is inclined to grant the request to adjourn the jury trial but would more than likely modify bail to cash.  Atty. Herbers takes a moment to discuss that with his client; Atty. Herbers advises that he is asking the court to take no action with respect to bail but if the court is inclined to modify bail he is asking it be set at no more than $100.00.  On its own motion the Court will order bail be modified to a $500.00 cash bond; all conditions to remain as previously set.
