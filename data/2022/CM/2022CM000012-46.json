LaPean appeared by video means from the Pepin County Jail with Attorney Schroeder by video means.  Attorney Jon D. Seifert appeared by phone means for Plaintiff State of Wisconsin.  Attorney Schroeder spoke with the social worker who is trying to get a hold of grandma to get her on the line as understand the State will be asking for $500 cash bond.  Court advises defendant of charges/max. penalties and constitutional rights.  State is familiar with Mr. LaPean regarding his juvenile record and concerned with not only battery to person who is is grandmother in the same location he's living and count 3 allegation of resisting an officer and willing to defy authorities.  State interested in what the alleged victim says and believe he should be on a cash bond and ask $500 cash bond.  He was fighting with the officers when taken into custody.  Under the criminal court he is an adult and once leave, he is a child.  Ask if his grandmother does not wish Mr. LaPean to go home, we set a JIPS or CHIPS and he should not be in jail and ask for signature bond.  This is a fault of the county and a child that would be homeless if his grandmother does not take him back and he be placed in jail is absurd.  I was unaware a 17 year old was in custody or I would have got something filed.  There is a 72 hour no contact that the department is asking be lifted.  Asking for a signature bond in this matter.  Court wants to hear from the State if wishing for no contact with this victim.  Attorney Seifert has not talked to victim and will not ask for a no contact.  Court wants to hear from the victim on what the Court should do in this matter.  Do you wish no contact with Noah? J.B., guardian grandmother.  Noah lives with her.  Are you willing to have Noah have contact with you?  Yes I would.  I signed a waiver to have Noah have contact with her.  State would not object to a signature bond given Mr. LaPean's age.  Court will let you out of jail.  Refrain from possessing or consuming alcohol, controlled substances w/o physician's prescription; refrain from any abuse contact with your Grandmother Julie.  State also ask he comply with grandmother's house rules and allow her to report any deviation.  Mr. LaPean agrees his grandmother is his guardian.  Court incorporates into the signature bond:  adhere to all reasonable rules of conduct established by your guardian grandmother.  Defendant confirms his address on file.
