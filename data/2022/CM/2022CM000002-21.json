Nagel - bond - asks for signature bond and informs Court who she will be residing with if granted. Court states concerns, haven't finished INIT and has bail jumping charges. Poler states she is on a PO hold until 1/22/22. State - bond - no objection to a reduction in cash bond, feels signature bond is inappropriate. Court - bond - reduces bond to $1000.00 signature bond with same conditions and add no contact with the victim (CP) - if victim wants that waived - she can go thru the proper procedures, sets for AIA on 1/12/22 at 10:00 AM, confirms address and phone number.","parties":[],"descr":"Initial appearance","amount":null,"key":"21-2022CM000002-8","ctofc":"Stenz, Leon D.","date":"2022-01-05","courtRptr":"Van Cleve, Jolene"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Electronic Filing Notice","amount":null,"key":"21-2022CM000002-3","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-01-04","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Case initiated by electronic filing","amount":null,"key":"21-2022CM000002-2","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-01-04","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Complaint filed","amount":null,"key":"21-2022CM000002-1","ctofc":"Stenz, Leon D.","date":"2022-01-04","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Poler, Larissa R"}],"descr":"Cash bond signed","amount":500.00,"key":"21-2022CM000002-7","ctofc":null,"date":"2021-12-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"from defendant asking for bond reduction","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"21-2022CM000002-6","ctofc":null,"date":"2021-12-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"No consumption of alcohol.","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Poler, Larissa R"}],"descr":"Cash bond set","amount":500.00,"key":"21-2022CM000002-5","ctofc":null,"date":"2021-12-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"cash bond set","parties":[],"descr":"Probable cause statement /judicial determination","amount":null,"key":"21-2022CM000002-4","ctofc":"Stenz, Leon D.","date":"2021-12-17","courtRptr":null}],"prosAgency":"District Attorney","citations":[],"defAttys":[{"name":"Halyburton, Breanna A."}],"balanceDue":0,"allowPurchase":false},"view":{"caseNo":{"value":"2022CM000002"},"countyNo":{"value":21}}}
