Attorney Jon D. Seifert appears by phone means for Plaintiff State of Wisconsin.  State asks the court to consider defendant entering into a DAGPA.  If you adhere to the contract for a period of one year, that matter would be dismissed.  If you fail to adhere to the contract, the agreement could be revoked and you would be subject to the max. penalties.  Mr. Dudgen informs him and his wife are going to marriage counseling instead of anger management.  Marriage counseling would be a substitute for the anger management class?  This is the first the DA has heard of the substitution.  The VWC has been in contact with the alleged victim and if she finds it's a fit substitute, we can talk about it.  The court will take your plea today subject to the terms of the contract.  Contact the DA and if he wishes to change the anger management requirement to marriage counseling he can, then you sign and a contract and file it.  The DA will then contact me and we will bring you back, rescind the contract and continue the case from that case forward.  The DA is to notify me of any changes in the contract.  Court advises defendant of charge/max. penalties.  Plea colloquy.  Defendant willing to proceed without counsel.  Court finds Mr. Dudgen knowingly, voluntarily waives right to counsel and other rights.  Defendant pleads guilty.  Court defers acceptance of GP for 1 year, terms to be filed by Mr. Seifert within 7 days.  Contact Mr. Seifert tomorrow.","parties":[],"descr":"Adjourned initial appearance","amount":null,"key":"46-2022CM000006-15","ctofc":"Clark, Thomas W.","date":"2022-05-03","courtRptr":"Henthorn, Ashley"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Proposed Order","amount":null,"key":"46-2022CM000006-14","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-04-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Video conferencing","amount":null,"key":"46-2022CM000006-13","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-04-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Adjourned initial appearance on May 3, 2022 at 01:30 pm.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"46-2022CM000006-12","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-04-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"01:59 PM Defendant Jeffrey Lawrence Duden in court without counsel.
