Case called.  Appearances given.  \nHaley Jo Johnson appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  \nDefendant Steven M. Zelich in court, in custody with attorney Jonathan Carver Smith.  \nAttorney Smith makes a record that prior to today they had one particular plea understanding with the State but that changed today.  Attorney Smith has relayed the reasons for the State's changed plea offer to his client.  Mr. Zelich has agreed to the new circumstances.  The initial agreement was for a plea to one count and dismiss and read-in Count 2.  The change in the offer is for the defendant to plead to both Count #1 and #2.  There would be a recommended sentence of 5 years of initial confinement followed by 5 years of extended supervision on each count, concurrent with each other and concurrent with the sentence he is now serving.  2:26 pm  Court asks if DA Necci is appearing on this case.  He indicates he is present here in court but is not appearing on this matter.  Court asks why there is no additional incarceration as a part of this agreement?  Atty Necci states in discussing this with law enforcement, they felt this was the best agreement in order to get the Defendant to the State of Minnesota to deal with the charges in that State.  Judge Reddy reads victim impact statement into the court record.  DA Necci makes record with regard to victim notification.  Court has some concerns and is not willing to proceed to sentencing on this record.  Court proposes either 1) taking a plea and ordering a PSI and setting a separate sentencing date or 2) scheduling this matter for trial.  Attorney Smith doesn't believe it is the intent of either side to proceed to trial, but more time is needed to be able to discuss this with Mr. Zelich.  He proposes resetting this matter for trial at this time.  If parties reach an agreement prior to the Final pre-trial or Jury Trial dates, they can contact the Court's clerk to schedule a hearing.  Counsel is advised that matter will be tried before Judge Drettwan as a result of judicial rotation on August 1st of this year.  \n\n2:36 pm  Court in recess.
