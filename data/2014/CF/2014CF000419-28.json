Attorney De La Rosa has concerns that she has not received notice of today's hearing--- Ms. Collins is no longer residing at the Lueder Haus, and he does not know where she is living currently.\nAgent Oddsen indicates that Ms. Collins still has not been in contact with him. \nThe Court orders issuance of a Bench Warrant- Body Only. \nThe Court revokes Bond, indicating that Ms. Collins is not to appear before a magistrate at daily Intake Court; instead Ms. Collins will remain in the Jail so that Agent Oddsen can meet with Ms. Collins in the Jail to conduct his Pre-Sentence Investigation and so that Ms. Collins is available for the Sentencing Hearing.\nThe Court indicates to Agent Oddsen that he should arrange with the Jail staff to flag this warrant/case so that the Jail staff notifies him as soon as Ms. Collins is taken into custody. \nThe Court instructs counsel that, once they are informed that Ms. Collins is in the Jail, they are to contact the JA to reset the sentencing hearing date.  The Court is removing the July 27th Sentencing Hearing date from its calendar.\nreess 9:12am.","parties":[],"descr":"Hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000419-42","ctofc":"Wambach, David J.","date":"2015-07-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"NOH for def sent to LKA","parties":[],"descr":"Return of unclaimed/undelivered mail service","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000419-41","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-07-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Court's response to letter from DOC : set hearing ASAP","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000419-40","ctofc":"Wambach, David J.","date":"2015-06-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Hearing at 07-09-2015 09:00 am","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000419-39","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-06-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Letter from DHS ref PSI","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000419-38","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-06-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Sentencing hearing at 07-27-2015 02:00 pm","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000419-37","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-06-04","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Scheduling Notice","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000419-36","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-05-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"with attached criminal case settlement","parties":[],"descr":"Plea questionnaire, waiver of rights","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000419-35","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-05-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Order for pre-sentence investigation","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000419-34","ctofc":"Wambach, David J.","date":"2015-05-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Patsy L Collins\nCurrent: C/O Lueder,   (Effective: 05-29-2015)\nPrior: 516 E.
