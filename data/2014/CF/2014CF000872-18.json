McReynolds in court with Attorney Colleen Marie Marion. Deputy District Attorney Peter J. Rindal appeared for the State of Wisconsin. Attorney Joel Larimore is also present.\nState advises is relying on its written submissions.\nCourt makes ruling on sentencing memorandum, laid out why Judge Gabler did a written sentencing which complied with statutory guidelines. Court advises statutory guidelines were met. Court orders defense motion is denied.\n\nParties address bolstering by the confidential informant. State makes statement regarding the investigator testifying three times and what was stated and also what was stated by the informant. Defense advises the jury is to be the lie detector in the room and law enforcement doesn't get to make decisions whether someone is telling the truth or not. Defense advises it was the jurys' job to determine if the informant was truthful. Defense also makes note of using present tense versus past tense. State advises questions were directed toward what was happening during time of investigation and not at present tense/date/time. Court advises the language used as not vouching and there was substantial testimony from the informant. Court orders the defense motion on vouching is denied.\n\nParties address questioning which let to defendants gang affiliation. State notes the informant was asked how the informant knew the defendants companion and there was no further questioning or follow up regarding the defendants gang affiliation. Defense wants to make record that they viewed the video and didn't see hand to hand exchange. Defense also advises the State can't say there was no follow up since the State asked the same question again and received a little more descriptive answer. Court addresses parties and touches on problematic and credibility issues surrounding the informant. Court also advises is basing decision off of this Judges review of information and not on former Judge Gablers' information/view. Court advises there is more than enough evidence to support a conviction and there is no need for a new trial. Court orders defense motion for credibility is denied.\nAttorney Joel Larimoe is excused.\n\nDefendant requests to make a record and would like to put an objection on the record. Defendant attempts to question subsequent jurisdiction of the court and the Court advises will not be discussed.
