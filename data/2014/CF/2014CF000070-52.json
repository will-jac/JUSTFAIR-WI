M states the parties have reached an agreement for resolution of all three matters in these two cases.  Atty. M states that the parties' joint recommendation calls for 6 mo jail, concurrent, on cts 2 and 3 and 40 days concurrent on ct 4 in 13CF48; on DPA count, which is subject to revocation motion of state; counsel jointly ask for 12 mo imposed/stayed jail, consecutive to any other sentence, for 4 years probation with conditions to include agent's recommendation and no contact with victims of that case.  In 14CF70, Atty. M states joint recomm. is for 4 mo imposed/stayed jail, consecutive to any other sentence, and stayed for probation of 4 years with conditions as deemed appropriate by the agent.

There is no credit on the 6 mo jail being requested.\n\nDiscussion re which agency shall collect the restitution on the probation-revoked counts in 13CF48.  Clerk will collect it, not probation.  Probation will only collect on those counts in which DOC supervises.\n\nAtty. M addresses Court; asks Court to allow def 30 days to report to jail.

Ask that imposed/stayed JOCs reflect huber as well.\n\nCourt follows joint agreement and orders the following:\n13CF48 - Count 2 - 6 mo county jail with huber; Count 3 - 6 mo jail, concurrent; Count 4 - 90 days jail, concurrent, with huber.
