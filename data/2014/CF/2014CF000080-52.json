Attorney David William Franker in court for Defendant Bradley W.I. Markin. Prosecuting Atty Jennifer M. Harper appeared for State of Wisconsin. Defendant Bradley W.I. Markin in court, in custody.  Counsel state the parties' recommendation of 4 mo jail imposed/stayed on counts 2 and 3 of 14CF80 for dismissal of count 1 in that case with 2 years probation that would include $1400 restitution to DG; def will also plead to counts 1, 2, and 3 for dismissal/read in of count 4 in 14CM59.  Atty. Franker states that the def would be entitled to 74 days credit in 14CF80.  Court has concerns with the jt recommendation and informs the parties that Court will not follow the plea agreement.  Court has noted def's extensive history which includes burglary counts; notes that, with the amount of credit, the jt recommendation would result in basically no penalty at all.  Knowing that, Def states he still wants to proceed with the plea and sentencing.  \n\nTo counts 2 and 3, theft and bail jumping, in 14CF80, def pleads no contest.
