Case called.  Appearances given.  Defendant Lucas D Smillie appeared, Matthew R. Leusink appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Probation Agent Nina Hanfler appears by phone.  Matter is before the Court for a probation review hearing.  Defendant is due to discharge from probation and has outstanding court obligations.  Agent Hanfler states that Defendant has been making payments but he has 2 cases - he also has a Jefferson County case.  Discussion as to whether any restitution has been paid by deft on either his Walworth County or Jefferson County case.  Defendant says he has made payments.  Defendant says he does work.  He lives with his wife and 3 kids.  She doesn't work - she is going to school.  Deft will be getting an advanced payment from his employer to pay off his court obligations.  Agent expresses confusion over the information she has with regard to defendant's payments because it seems to show restitution is paid.  Court orders 1 year extension of probation and defendant's probation can  terminate once his court ordered financial obligations are paid in full.  Agent Hanfler is going to need to figure out exactly what Mr. Smillie now owes so that Mr. Smillie can know what he has to pay to get his obligations paid off in full.   Court asks that Agent prepare an Order extending probation Mr. Smillie's probation for one year.  If his obligations are paid in full prior to his current discharge date, then his probation will not need to be extended.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000245-34","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2016-12-15","courtRptr":"Matoska, Linda"},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing on December 15, 2016 at 11:00 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000245-33","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-10-27","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Notice of court ordered financial obligations","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000245-32","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-10-03","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Original filed with the court.","parties":[],"descr":"Writ of Habeas Corpus","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000245-31","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2015-01-21","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Assessment Report","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000245-30","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-01-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Judgment of conviction","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000245-29","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2015-01-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Assessment Report","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000245-28","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-01-14","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Notice and acknowledge of def voting ineligibility","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000245-23","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-01-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Order for Community Service","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000245-22","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2015-01-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Dispositional order/judgment","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000245-27","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2015-01-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Plea questionnaire, waiver of rights","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000245-26","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2015-01-09","courtRptr":"Grzenia, Eileen"},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Lucas D Smillie in court with attorney James B.
