Sufficient factual basis to support the plea and the def is found guilty.\nNelson: Talked to the officer about this and he was open to resolving this w/o a felony conviction but she really went after him that evening. When it got to the point where she used profanities, it started escalating. She has a history here and  that's why we oppose expunction. \nBarton: Her actions that night were appalling and she will admit that but it's not who she is. Alc played a role in this. She acknowledges that she needs to address those issues and she's doing that. \nDef: I can't use alc as an excuse but it's the root of the problem. I don't remember a thing. It's not like me to act like that. When I read the report it didn't sound like me and I didn't even believe it was real. I would like expunction. \nCrt: You say that's not your character but this is the 2nd time you are resistant to officers under the influence of alc. Looking at your conduct, you're profane, assaultive to an officer; mouthy; immature and bratty. This is the 2nd time you've responded that way to an officer and looks like the officer was trying to help someone one might have needed assistance. I would be concerned about that if I were you. Barton makes a good suggestion but concerned of the monitoring and ensuring there's oversight for her if she were to fall short. I am reluctant to use probation but she had a similar incident 3 yrs ago and there needs to be oversight to ensure she succeeds and treatment needs are met\nSENTENCE:\nSentence withheld - 12 mos probation on all 3 counts concurrent\nCond:  ct. 4 - 30 days CJ to be served on EM thru JS.
