Court:  Mr. Colbert, you don't get to choose what you can do.  I don't have anything acout the aftercare program.  You know the system fairly well.  This something you need to be responsible for.  Skemp:  He just got released this moning.  Court:  So he has no where to live. I think you should go back to the homeless program.  I don't feel comfortable with you just living in a home even if the DOC thinks it's OK.  You have to communicate what's going on.\n\nI'm going to keep that you have to comply with the VA after care program.
