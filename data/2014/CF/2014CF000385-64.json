Case called.  Probation Agent Cassandra Botica.  Defendant Justin W Prescott appeared, Zeke S Wiedenfeld appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Court notes defendant has not paid any of the restitution.  Ms. Botica does not believe defendant has made a good faith effort.  Atty Wiedenfeld makes record as to compliance with victims rights.  He is requesting an extension of probation.  Mr. Prescott  has been in recovery from heroin addition.  He did recently receive a promotion at work giving him the opportunity to get his head above water.  Court does not believe up until now he has made a good faith effort.  Court will extend probation for 2 years.  If he gets it paid off earlier than the 2 years, defendant can discharge from probation.
