Ct 4:  5 yr bifurcated SEH - 2 yrs IC/3 yrs ES.  Ct 5:  36 mos bifurcated SEH - 18 mos IC/18 mos ES.  12CF-120:  4 yr term of imprisonment bifurcated SEH - 2 yrs IC/2 yrs ES.  12CF-71:  8 mos WCJ.  14CM-9 Ct 1: 8 mos WCJ  14CM-9 Ct 2:  6 mos WCJ. - Those 2 sentences concurrent with Ct 1 12CF-71 - all of jail sentences concurrent with 12CF-120 - with credit for 123 days of TS credit against those sentences.  \n \n\nThose sentences are all concurrent to one another and are all concurrent to term of imprisonment in 12CF-120 and concurrent to 12CF-71 and 14CM-9.  \nTerms of ES on each case:  Completion of AODA and any follow thru; Ab Sobriety; Bar Prohibition; No possession of any impairing substances unless valid RX; court costs inclusive of DNA for every charge and costs of $310 in purchase money related to the transactions of Cts 1-4 of INFO.

Atty Goldin not appointed on CV case and offers proposal to not forfeit buy money and apply accordingly.  Court has no authority on application - statute clear on where money is to go once forfeited.  Def states he now wishes to continue to contest asset forfeiture case.  Hearing scheduled for that case - Defendant may appear via video for that hearing from the institution and will appear pro se.  Atty Goldin confirms receipt of correspondence from DA's office and that correspondence is returned directly to Def.
