Case called.  Appearances given.  \nDA Zeke S Wiedenfeld appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  \nDefendant Jason L. Grant in court, in custody with attorney James B. Duquette.  \nCourt notes the victims, Jessica Kowalski is also present.  \nMatter is before the Court for a final hearing on the NGI plea.  \nCourt makes record with regard to reports that the Court ordered after defendant was found guilty at trial and reasons the Court vacated those Orders.  \n4:04 pm  Statement by victim Jessica L. Kowalski.  \n4:09 pm  Argument by Atty Wiedenfeld in support of institutional care.  \n4:18 pm  Argument by Atty Duquette.  Atty Duquette wants to first address the length of the commitment.  Defendant does not wish to give up the right to be reviewed / re-examined by a doctor.  \n4:23 pm  Court proceeds with making its record.  Court quotes from different parts of Doctor's report.  Court notes that both Dr. Rawski and Ms. Martinez of DHS believe that a dispositional report / exam at this time would be premature since defendant is currently serving a prison sentence.  Court finds there is clear and convincing evidence that conditional release at this time would pose a significant risk of bodily harm to others as well as to himself.  Court will place him in institutional care.  Court next addresses issue of involuntary administration of medication.  Response by Atty Duquette.  Court believes Dr. Rawski's' opinion with regard to involuntary administration of medication still relevant today.  Court finds that there is clear and convincing evidence that there needs to be an Order for involuntary treatment and medication.  Court does not believe he is competent to refuse it.  Court next addresses defendant's request to reconsider the commitment period.  Court believes the 60 year term of the commitment is absolutely required here given the seriousness of the charges, the seriousness of his illness, the risk he poses to the public.  After he is released from prison, he would be able to petition for conditional release.  Atty Duquette asks if commitment is concurrent with or consecutive to the prison sentence he is now serving?  Atty Wiedenfeld asks that it be consecutive.  Court makes record and orders that the commitment be consecutive to his current prison sentence.  4:45 pm  Court in recess.\n\n*TRANSCRIPT FILED 1-3-18: COURT REPORTER LINDA MATOSKA*","parties":[],"descr":"Hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-78","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2017-05-05","courtRptr":"Matoska, Linda"},{"addlTxt":"4/28/2017 - E-mails between Attys and Court, re:  cancellation of PDI and SME reports","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-77","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-04-28","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"04/27/2017 Letter from Dr.  Rawski, re: Phase III dispositional eval\n4/27/2017 - E-mail responses to Court from DA Wiedenfeld & Atty Duquette","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-75","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-04-27","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"4/26/2017 - E-mail from Kathleen Martinez of DHS, re:  PDI and SME reports ordered by Court\n4/26/2017 - E-mail from Clerk to Attys forwarding e-mail from Kathleen Martinez of DHS","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-76","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-04-26","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Order for Supplementary Examination NGI","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-67","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2017-04-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Order for Predisposition Investigation","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-66","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2017-04-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"NGI","parties":[],"descr":"Order for commitment","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-65","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2017-04-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"04/19/17 email to WCS/BC contact RE: Order for NGI, PDI and Commitment","parties":[],"descr":"Received documents","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-64","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-04-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"fax confirmations to B.C. for Order for Commitment, Supplementary NGI exam and PDI","parties":[],"descr":"Received documents","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-63","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-04-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Dispositional order/judgment","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-92","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2017-04-18","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Plea hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-91","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2017-04-18","courtRptr":"Matoska, Linda"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Plea questionnaire, waiver of rights","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-73","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-04-18","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Random Listing Report","parties":[],"descr":"Jury selection","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-68","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-04-18","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Exhibit list","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000471-62","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-04-18","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"BAILIFFS:  George Clettenberg and Sharri Loveless.  \n8:30 am  Court in session.
