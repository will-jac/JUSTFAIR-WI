first needs to be established before going any further with the Motion.\nDiscussion between Court and Attorneys.  \nAttorney Hunt believes it is too early to make a call as to whether the defendant is entitled to exercise self defense.  \nAttorney Necci argues that the question is \"have they adequately raised self-defense?\" \nAttorney Necci believes it is a determination that the Court has to make at trial.  \nResponse by Attorney Necci to Court question as to statements made by defendant to the Officers. \nAttorney Hunt believes that McMorris requires an affirmative obligation of the defense to come forward ahead of time\nCourt will take this under advisement and at such time that Attorney Hunt believes there has been an adequate basis for self-defense, then this can be addressed.\nCourt makes a record with regard to Defense Motion to Exclude Other Acts Evidence.\nAttorney Necci advises that the State has no basis or knowledge of anything the State would consider an other act.  \nAttorney Hunt makes a record as to incidents of violence by the victim.  \nAttorney Hunt believes he can only introduce things that the Defendant was actually aware of but if there is some introduction through\nother witnesses that the victim had a reputation for peacefulness, then Attorney Hunt would be able to go into that.  \nResponse by Attorney Necci.  \nCourt next deals with
