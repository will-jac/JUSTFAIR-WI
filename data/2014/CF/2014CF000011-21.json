State - has reviewed the revocation packet - makes final statement prior to recommendations - recommends 3.5 years in the WI State Prison System consisting of 1 year of initial confinement followed by 2.5 years of ES - defendant has substantial credit. Court makes comment as to what the DOC has recommended (9 months). State is aware of their recommendation and disagrees with it especially due to all the credit he has coming. Court asks for the past criminal history of the defendant. State informs Court of the defendant's criminal history. Burns makes final argument prior to recommendations - does point out an inaccuracy in the revocation paperwork - states the defendant has 259 days jail credit - recommends 9 months in jail. State comes up with 201 days credit. Larock withholds comment.
