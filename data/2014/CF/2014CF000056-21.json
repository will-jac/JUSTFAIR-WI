Leland Berg appears in person and in custody with Mary Burns. State appears by Charles Simono. State - resolved - has complied with victim notification requirements and provides court with it. Court reviews letter from victim. State informs the Court that the victim was not notified of today's date but has never had any response from any previous notices. Court satisfied with State's efforts. State - defendant would plead G to counts #2 and #3 as alleged, DRI counts #1 and #4, count #2 - fine of $500 plus costs and surcharges, 60 days in FC jail - consecutive to any other jail he is currently serving; count #3 - withhold sentence and place on probation for 3 years with conditions of: costs and surcharges, AODA and follow thru, anger management and follow thru, absolute sobirety, no possession of alcohol and no entry into any bars or taverns, employment/school, 200 hours of community service, take all meds as prescribed by treating physician or medical provider, no contact with the victim except as court ordered for child custody or as allowed by P&P. Burns makes statement regarding the no contact condition and states she was not aware that the jail time on count #2 was consecutive to current jail time. State shows Ms. Burns that condition on the plea agreement. Burns now argues for some credit on this matter - at least 30 days. Burns now wants an adjournment until Friday. Court continues bond, set for another PLEAS on 9/5/14 at 8:30 AM. Burns to let Court know if the defendant does not agree to joint recommendation as it is currently set for JT on 9/12/14.","parties":[],"descr":"Plea/sentencing hearing","amount":null,"key":"21-2014CF000056-34","ctofc":"Stenz, Leon D.","date":"2014-09-03","courtRptr":"Van Cleve, Jolene"},{"addlTxt":"LB","parties":[],"descr":"Order to produce","amount":null,"key":"21-2014CF000056-33","ctofc":"Hatfield, Deborah","date":"2014-09-02","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"State's","parties":[],"descr":"Witness list - plaintiff","amount":null,"key":"21-2014CF000056-32","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-08-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Jury trial on September 12, 2014 at 08:30 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"21-2014CF000056-31","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-07-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Called at 1:21 PM.
