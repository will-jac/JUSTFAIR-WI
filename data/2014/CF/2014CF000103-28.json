ADA Monica Hall appears for the State of Wisconsin.\nAttorney Westrick explains that Defendant Mark Burrow likely does not appear because Attorney Westrick's staff sent Mr. Burrow a letter about Attorney Westrick having a scheduling conflict for today's court date.  The letter referenced a new hearing date of August 8th at 8:45am.  However there have been changes in Attorney Westrick's schedule, and also DA Happ has indicated that the State wanted today's hearing to remain on the calendar due to new Felony Bailjumping allegations in newly-filed case #14CF269.\nAttorney Westrick indicates that he can only communicate with Mr. Burrow by mail because Mr. Burrow's phone has been disconnected. \nThe Court re-raises a concern regarding Attorney Westrick's ability to serve as court-appointed counsel in these cases, especially now that the new case #14CF269 involves the Fort Atkinson Police Department.  Attorney Westrick indicates that he will not be able to represent Mr. Burrow in the newest case. \n\nAfter discussion with counsel, the Court reschedules the hearing to August 8th at 8:45, indicating that the Court will mail notices today to Mr. Burrow, and that the notices will include wording that instructs Mr. Burrow to disregard any notification received previously from Attorney Westrick's office, and clarifying that Mr. Burrow must personally appear at the hearing. \nADA Hall informs the Court and Defense that the State's previous plea offer is now withdrawn. \nrecess 9:39am. \n\nNEXT:  Schedule all three cases for hearing on August 8th at 8:45am.; the notice is to include wording that instructs Mr. Burrow to disregard any court-date notification received previously from Attorney Westrick's office and emphasizing in bold printing that Mr. Burrow must appear personally at the hearing;  \n--cases #14CF33 & #14CF103 will be Status Conference and Motion Hearing on State's Motion to Modify Bond (JA- note in comments that attorney conflict concerns need to be addressed and inquiry made whether Mr. Burrow may now qualify for PD representation) \n--case #14CF269 will be Initial Appearance (JA- please note in comments that amendment of Complaint is needed to correct demographics) \n","parties":[],"descr":"Status conference","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000103-24","ctofc":"Weston, Jennifer L","date":"2014-08-05","courtRptr":"Schueler, Erica L."},{"addlTxt":"States motion for bond modification","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of motion, motion","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000103-23","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-08-04","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Pre-trial conference on July 16, 2014 at 10:00 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000103-22","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-06-24","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Status conference on August 5, 2014 at 09:30 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000103-21","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-06-18","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Pre-trial conference on August 5, 2014 at 09:30 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000103-20","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-06-18","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Information","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000103-19","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-06-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Prelim questionnaire and waiver","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000103-18","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-06-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Cases 14CF33 & 14CF103 called at 11:05 am\nDefendant Mark A.
