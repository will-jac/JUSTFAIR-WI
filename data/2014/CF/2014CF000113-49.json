Mcleod in court with attorney Edmund Jelinski and D. Nicholas Carroll. Defendant Brian J. Mcleod in custody.  \nCass Cousins appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\n\nAtty Jelinski makes arguments to modify the bond at this time.  He has a maintenance job at Elizabeth Inn waiting for him.  Asks to modify $50,000 to a significantly lower cash bond.  Was to have his wisdom teeth removed a week after his arrest.  Causing him discomfort.  Is experiencing anxiety and depression and has a meeting with the Social Worker.  Wonder if he could have a psychological evaluation.  Not talking about an NGI plea or competency.  \nAtty Cousins makes arguments in opposition to the modification of bond.  Charges are substantial.  Facing 79 1/2 years of incarceration on all counts.  Inherent risk of flight.  There was talk of fleeing to Texas to avoid.  Previous escape charges.  Originally State recommended a $100,000 cash bond. \nAtty Jelinski makes additional arguments to the Court.  Escape charges were before he had a family.  Believes it was Nowak who indicated going to Texas.  He never had any intention of fleeing. \nCourt questions damage amount listed in the complaint. \nAtty Cousins responds.  That amount was damages to items still remaining in the house. \nAtty Jelinski responds.  House was uninhabited at this time.  \nCourt questions Atty Jelinski.  \nAtty Jelinski indicates house was not insured.  Discovery gives no indication of what the value of the building was. \n\nBY THE COURT: \nMonetary condition of bond is to assure defendant's appearances.  Initially set by Judge Finn.  Court has reviewed the complaint and heard arguments of the parties today.  Court notes defendant faces signification prison time.   Case against the defendant, atleast on paper, seems to be fairly strong.  Defendant admitted to being at the home that was burned.  Another witness has placed the defendant in the area.  State has indicated they will be pursuing a prison sentence.  Defendant has a past criminal history and significant history that has sent him to prison in the past.  Was on probation when this case took place.  Certainly gives the defendant incentive to flee.  Court believes the defendnant is a significant risk of flight and Court will deny the motion to modify the bond.  With regard to the wisdom teeth, that is an issue for the defendant to deal with in the jail and the Court will not order a psychological evaluation at this point but may wish to discuss with the Social Worker at the jail.","parties":[],"descr":"Bail/bond hearing","amount":null,"key":"49-2014CF000113-18","ctofc":"Eagon, Thomas B.","date":"2014-05-09","courtRptr":"Sosnowski, Cathy"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Pre-trial conference data","amount":null,"key":"49-2014CF000113-17","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-04-24","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Jury trial - 12 person on October 15, 2014 at 08:30 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"49-2014CF000113-16","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-04-23","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Demand for discovery and inspection","amount":null,"key":"49-2014CF000113-15","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-04-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Information","amount":null,"key":"49-2014CF000113-14","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-04-07","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Pre-trial conference on April 21, 2014 at 11:30 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"49-2014CF000113-13","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-04-07","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Atty Jelinski makes arguments in support of motion to modify bond.
