Appearances given.  ADA Samuel Berg appears on behalf of the State.  Deft and Probation Agent Shannon Stydahar appear by phone.  Case is on for a probation review hearing.  At last hearing, Deft said he could pay $100 per month.  Response by Agent as to payments made by deft.  He was paying $80 per month but then it was reduced to $50 per month due to COVID issues.  Deft confirms that he has made this payments.  Approximately $6,000 is owed.  There is a co-deft that has been making some payments.  Agent advises there have been no violations of probation in the past year and has been making payments toward restitution.  ADA Berg goes not believe the victim was notified.  He indicates it was not a \"must notify\" case.  Agent indicates Dept. it not making a recommendation one way or the other.  With amount of restitution owing, Dept. would most likely request an extension but has not been formally discussed with Supervisor.  9:57 am  Response by ADA Berg.  He makes record as to payments that have been made and based upon Agent's recommendation to extend, the State is requesting an extension.  Deft says he would continue to make the payments even he was not on probation.  Deft's probation is due to expire on December 7th.  Court would have certainly that he was making a good faith effort if he had paid $100 per month - but due to COVID, he wasn't able to make those payments.  Statement by Deft that he owes \"back pay\".  Deft has paid $830.00 since the last hearing.  If he remains on probation, he will be asked to pay $80 per month or possibly more.  Deft says he did make another payment of $50 this month - and next month he will start making $80 per month toward restitution.  Court is happy to see Deft has been doing well on probation.  If he pays $80 per month for 1 year - Court would find that it's good faith if he makes those payments.

There was an  issue that deft didn't want to pay because co-actor has not paid.  Mr. Zunker has continued to make monthly payments and has increased the amount of his payments.  He has obtained part time employment to increase his payments.  Deft says he will consistently make his payments.  He would like to get off probation and continue to make payments toward restitution.  Atty Johnson asks that deft's probation be extended.  Response by Mr. Zunker that he could increase his payments to $100 per month but what he makes at work affects his SSI.  3:05 pm  Response by Court.  Deft says he was told that he could make payments to the Court.  Court explains that if a civil judgment is entered, the Court can't enforce payments.  Court will Order probation extended for 1 year and finds Mr. Zunker has not made a good faith effort because he says he can pay more and for awhile he wasn't paying.  Agent will prepare Order extending probation.  3:07 pm  Court in recess.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000073-45","ctofc":"Koss, Phillip A.","date":"2019-10-15","courtRptr":"Schulz, Janet L"},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing on October 15, 2019 at 03:00 pm.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000073-44","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-08-28","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Notice of court ordered financial obligations","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000073-43","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-08-01","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"8:49 am  Defendant Thomas R Zunker appeared, Zeke S Wiedenfeld appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Probation Agent Stydaher-Schultz appears by phone.  Matter is on this morning because of a request by the Agent for a probation review hearing.  Deft was convicted and placed on probation for 3 years.  Restitution was ordered and he is jointly and severally responsible with the co-actor for this restitution.  He is still on probation until November of 2019 but Court received letter from Agent indicating Mr. Zunker was refusing to pay restitution.  8:52 am  Response by Mr. Zunker.  He requests he be required to pay half of the restitution (50/50 with co-actor) as he believes co-actor has not been paying his share.  Mr. Zunker has faithfully made about $60 per month payments.  He receives disability payments approx $700 per month.  He has paid $60 per month for most of his probation supervision.  Mr. Zunker says he receives SSI and has recently just started a job but only works 1 day a week.  He is hoping for more shifts in the future.  Mr. Zunker has paid $2,032.70 and $484.29 has been paid by co-actor.  He is working at Brewhaus as a dishwasher but only receives 5 hours on Wednesdays.  9:00 am  Atty Wiedenfeld asks that the Court instruct defendant that he must continue to make payments toward restitution as it was joint and several.  9:01 am  Further statement by Mr. Zunker.  9:02 am  Court makes record that he has been ordered to pay restitution joint and several with his co-actor.  Court is not willing to order that he pay more than $60 per month because no one seems to be clear on how much he can earn without being penalized on his SSI disability.  Court suggests that Agent and defendant investigate this so see how much more he can earn in wages without being penalized.  9:05 am  Response by Agent.  9:06 am  Court in recess.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000073-42","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2018-06-08","courtRptr":"Matoska, Linda"},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing on June 8, 2018 at 08:30 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000073-41","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-05-23","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Memo from DOC re: requesting Probaton Review Hearing","parties":[],"descr":"Memorandum","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000073-40","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-04-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Records of prosec. are converted data.
