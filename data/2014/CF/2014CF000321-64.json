The deft delivered the drugs to Angel Cruz in Illinois and then made a separate choice to get in the car with Angel Cruz and drive to Walworth County.  Court finds that when the deft chose to drive up to Walworth County so that Angel Cruz could continue the chain of drug selling, the deft committed a separate volitional act to go with Angel Cruz in Wisconsin to deliver the drugs.  Court notes the deft did not plead in federal court to counts 1, 2 and 3.  He actually plead to count 5.  Court finds that it is not the same act and are separate volitional acts, separate conduct.
