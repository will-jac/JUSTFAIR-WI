State - here on two different issues - State filed a motion and makes argument for motion - restitution should be made payable to Forest County Potawatomi Community instead of to victim (CD) - asks court to amend restitution owed to Forest County Potawatomi Community (FCPC) Health Insurance Department. The victim is in the courtroom today and has no objections to the JOC being amended to the restitution amount being paid to FCPC Health Insurance Department. COC office has already issued a check for $150.00 to the victim - State will have the victim sign this check over to FCPC Health Insurance Department and then amend JOC to reflect the victim is FCPC Health Insurance Department. State - other issue is in regards to the apology letter submitted by the defendant. State offers exhibits #1, #2 and #3 - apology letters written by defendant to the victim. Court reviews exhibits (11:56 AM). State - wants court to hear from victim in this matter regarding the letters. Court has victim make statement regarding the apology letters - not requesting that the court order the defendant to write another apology letter for stated reasons. Madl responds. Court not making exhibits part of the record for stated reasons. Court - amend JOC to reflect correct victim - not ordering the defendant to write another apology letter as victim is not requesting another one (for previoulsy stated reasons) but instructs him on the right thing to do - no further action will be taken - instructs defendant to make sure he follows rules of probation - gave documents back to State.
