Atty Bucher has filed a Motion to adjourn the trial.  Atty Bucher argues that there is an outstanding Motion before Judge Reddy to compel discovery which was never addressed.  He indicates that the government did respond to his discovery demand but said it did not have that discovery.  Atty Bucher states there are approximately 600 pages of discovery that he received on February 27th and he has only gotten through about 1/3 of it.  Attorney Donohoo argues that the State is not going to incur any time or expense to get records that are not in its custody and control and that the State does not intend to use at trial.  Anything in the State's custody and control has been given to the defense.  Victims are present in court.  Attorney Bucher makes record with regard to a civil action that had been filed.  The defendant is willing to waive his right to a jury trial and have a court trial.  The State is also willing to waive jury trial.  This is a legal issue and not a factual issue.  Court has colloquy with the defendant with regard to waiver of jury trial.  Court finds defendant's waiver to be free and voluntary and will schedule the matter for a court trial.
