All parties appear via Zoom video.  Court informs def of right to appear in person for this proceeding, defendant will have an opportunity to discuss that with his lawyer off the record in a breakout room.  Off the record, 3:36 PM, Court's Zoom screen went black.  Back on the record 3:46 PM, same appearances as previously noted.  Court notes Burnett County clerk also appears telephonically, not previously noted on the record.  Court questions defendant regarding right to appear in person, waives KIV and wishes to proceed via video conferencing.  Case on for motion hearing on defense's motion for postconviction relief.  Atty Breedlove argues for \"no contact with minors\" to be corrected to \"No contact with minor females, except with agent approval (or no contact with minor females without agent approval)\".  Atty Rennicke rests on his brief and the arguments therein.  Court reviews history of the case, cites transcripts from prior sentencing hearings, notes the judge's words were \"no contact with minor females\", Court will change to ES condition \"No contact with any minor females except for T.H., but any contact with T.H. must be supervised, meaning supervised by a person who is an adult over the age of 18 and is at all times completely monitoring that interaction.  Supervised contact with T.H. must also be approved by defendant's supervising agent.\"  Atty Breedlove notes the defendant has raised an issue regarding amounts that are taken out.
