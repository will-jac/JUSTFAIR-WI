DA asks for $10000 signature bond in each case; notes def is presently in the prison system and will be for the next two years.  DA notes that she received a speedy dispo request from the def on Monday - request wasn't signed and wasn't received by the clerk.  Atty.

M states that def made the request not understanding what it was for; thought that having pending cases affected his ability to be released.  \n\nDef waives formal reading of the complaints in all five cases.

DA notes that the single count in 14CF98 is a misdemeanor; case was filed as a felony due to DA's office error.  DA states that, rather than having the error corrected at this point, she'd ask that the matter remain as listed; may resolve when the others matters resolve.\n\nAtty.

Def states he filed his request after the prison system came to him and stated that he could be moved to a min-security facility with treatment; that's why he send the paperwork; he did it before he'd talked with his attorney; didn't know it was going to interfere; states parole board said they'd see him in May; possibility for treatment might not come up in another six months to a year.  Def states he's not in min-security right now because of these open charges; felt pressured at the time he made the requests to make them for the reasons he has stated.  Atty.
