[MK]\nDefendant Young J Choi appears via videoconferencing from Mendota Mental Health Institute.  His counsel, Attorney Michael Witt, is present in court.  DA Susan Happ appears in court for the State of Wisconsin.  \r\nThe Court makes inquiries to the staffperson at MMHI to verify that Mr. Choi can see and hear the court proceedings. \r\nCounsel acknowledge receipt of Dr. Phelps' 12/30/14 Competency Report.\nThe Court summarizes that the Statutes do not cover the situation presented by this Report which indicates that Mr. Choi is still not competent, but that he is likely to become competent within the statutory period with medication and treatment, however there is no order for involuntary medication or treatment. Because the Report indicates that with medication and treatment Mr. Choi is likely to become competent, then under sub (C) and sub (b) the Court is not precluded from holding a hearing under sub (4). \nThe Court cites the limited statutory time involved for Mr. Choi to regain competency; under these circumstances, the Court can hold a hearing under sub (4) even absent a motion. \nIn response to the Court's inquiry, counsel agree that the requirements of sub (5)(b) are met within the Report. \nThe Court believes it can appropriately operate under Statute 971.14(4); and that due process notice is provided to the Defense;  the Court is proceeding under sub (4)(b). \nrecess 9:01am, reconvene 9:05am\nOn agreement of counsel, the Court finds that the videoconferencing system is sight and sound sufficient. \nThe Court receives the stipulations of counsel regarding the doctor's qualifications, and regarding the finding of Dr. Phelps that Mr. Choi continues to be incompetent.   \nThe Court makes a good cause finding to receive the doctor's testimony by telephone under Statute 807.13(2)(C)\nDr. Mark Phelps- sworn & testifies (by telephone) \n--direct examination by DA Happ\n--cross examination by Attorney Witt\n--redirect examination by DA Happ\n--recross examination by Attorney Witt\n--examination by the Court \n--follow up examination by DA Happ\n--follow up examination by Attorney Witt\n\nArguments given by Attorney Witt.  \nThe Court finds that the State has proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that an order for involuntary treatment and medication is appropriate. The Court concludes that it is unlikely that Mr. Choi will take the current medication or any other psychotropic medication at a level sufficient to address his illness.\nUnder Statute 971.14(4)(b), the Court finds that the State has met its burden for the Court to issue the order for involuntary treatment and medication.\nrecess 9:53am.\n\nNEXT:  DA Happ is to submit a proposed order on a five-day objection basis \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","parties":[],"descr":"Competency hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000217-55","ctofc":"Wambach, David J.","date":"2015-01-15","courtRptr":"Weaver, Nancy"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Video conferencing","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000217-54","ctofc":"Wambach, David J.","date":"2015-01-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"The hearing scheduled for 1-15-15 shall remain as scheduled","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000217-58","ctofc":"Wambach, David J.","date":"2015-01-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Proposed stip and order for adjournment","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000217-53","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-01-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Competency hearing on January 15, 2015 at 08:30 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000217-52","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-01-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Progress Report (with fax cover page)","parties":[],"descr":"Competency report","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000217-50","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-01-02","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Judicial transfer","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000217-48","ctofc":"Wambach, David J.","date":"2015-01-02","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Adversary Counsel","parties":[],"descr":"Order appointing counsel","amount":null,"key":"28-2014CF000217-47","ctofc":"Weston, Jennifer L","date":"2014-12-16","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Order/letter from the Court to Atty.
