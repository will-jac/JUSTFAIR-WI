The legal effect of a finding of not guilty by reason of mental\n    disease or defect is that the court must commit the defendant to the\n    custody of the Department of Health and Family Services.\n  </p><p data-section-name=\"notice\">\n    <strong>Notice to employers:</strong> It may be a violation of state law to\n    discriminate against a job applicant because of an arrest or conviction\n    record.
