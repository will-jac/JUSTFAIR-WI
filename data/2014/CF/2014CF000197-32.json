Atty. D. Bolles by phone.  Ed Minser appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\n\nBolles:  Motion sets the basis.  He WOULD benefit from in-patient treatment.  My motion says he would not.  That's a typo.  He's not a high risk.  He's on a PO hold and not going anywhere anytime soon.  He would just sit on cash until trial.  His PO his hoping he can get into in-patient treatment.  Asks the Court to consider reducing the cash to a small amount.  Minser:  We're looking at his history in the compas report.  He's been to prison 3 times but has gone back much more than 3 times.  So there are errors in the compas report.  He is a risk.  He has failed to appear previously.  Sites more history.\nCOURT:  If the PO believe there's an alternative, I'll consider changing the bond then.  The current cash bond will remain.  With that long history, it's very unlikely an alternative will be proposed.  Minser:  The DE filed a speedy trial damand and we're now outside that time frame.
