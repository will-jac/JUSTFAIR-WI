Viau in court with attorney Robert Gerald Lebell.  Scott C. Blader appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Ruth Zouski, Corporation Counsel, also present in court.  Court has reviewed in camera records. Atty Lebell speaks as to nature of motion.  The Court applies 4th amendment standard as to evaluation of records.  Generic synopsis provided as to records reviewed that will be retained under seal.  Records not relevant to this case.  Absent further argument by State, revelation of records declined and to remain under seal.  Atty Lebell argues as to CPS records.  Argument by DA:  Not the record holder requests specifics as to which records.  Argument by Atty Lebell - under concept of due diligence is requesting certain records.  Records are relevant to his expert he intends to call.  State has no objection to release of records, tho personally not in his control or responsibility to produce.  Corp Counsel states she will abide by whatever the Court orders however Def is not a parent or party to that investigation.  The Court:  Any DHS or law enforcement personnel - finds that revelation of those reports is essential to a fair and complete trial of the issues.  Directs that any DHS reports, notes, or other documentation reflecting contact or interaction with the complainant as relates to this case be revealed under a protective order.  PO will require that a single copy of records produced by the state, number and then be made available to defense counsel and not to be reproduced.  Defense has the Court's permission to reveal docs to any expert retained.  Any reports that require reproduction not to occur unless necessity demonstrated to the Court.  Docs to be retained by Atty Lebell during pendency of this action until concluded.  Once concluded, documents to be returned to the State for retention.   Expert may be reviewed by any expert under supervision of Atty Lebell.  Defense file retention to be addressed at a later date should challenge occur.  DA argues as to law enforcement personnel files - officer's direct files.  Atty Zouski has generated a report after her review of the personnel files.  Atty Lebell argues that the State is supposed to be reviewing the files to determine any credibility issues.  Corp Counsel offers files to the Court for in camera inspection.  Court recites what is relevant as per case law on credibility and/or falsity.  Court will review files personally and will then correspond to counsel post review - 5 files total.  Atty Lebell argues final point as to number of times victim had been interviewed.  Court believes protocol established for review of records and law enforcement files will cover this concern.  Atty Lebell states substantive issues still need to be addressed prior to any trial. Counsel looking toward a 3 days JT.  Counsel discuss potential experts for trial.
