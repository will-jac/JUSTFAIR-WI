Plea QN reviewed w/Defendant. Meds serving no impairment on proceeding today.   Plea colloquy entertained.  Collateral consequences explained. Chapter 950 compliance addressed. ADA states confusion remains on restitution that may need to be clarified at a later hearing. No initial claim rec'd from victim, though monies were paid by RCGI in the amount of $500.00 that needs clarification. Per Atty Lennon:  It was the understanding that Def would not be responsible for any restitution.  Adm sanction called for payment of $500.00 paid directly to RCGI - does not believe that any further restitution should be ordered - Victim is not entitled to any payment by Defendant.   Court accepts State's motion to amend to Misd Battery contrary 940.19(1) Plea:  NC  Court accepts plea and enters JOC.  Statement by Def:  Yes.  Atty Lennon states for the record the sanctions imposed by RCGI due to this incident - severe sanction received.  Statement by Captain of RGCI as to Adm sanction of $500 imposed.  The Court: Adopts recommendation imposed  S/W - 1 yr probation. Probation is consecutive to any sentence that is now existing (after)  probation to commence when current incarceration ends.
