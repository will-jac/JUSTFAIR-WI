COURT:  You're asking that the cash be reduced to a $5,000 cash bond.  Address' Ms. Marr's mother and grandmother about the possiblity loosing the $5,000 if I go along with this request...  You're giving $5,000 for the treatment program and now $5,000 for bond.  Grandma says family has come up with the bond.  Ins. has reduced the program fee to $2,500.  They understand theossibility of loosing the bond money.  Mom:  She really, really needs this treatment.  I just have to believe in her.  Grandma:  Her just getting out of the area is a good thing.  I don't know that em is necessary.  The facility is secured.  Court:  It sounds like the facility can serve the same monitory sevice.  Minsor feels the em is appropriate. Even just to get her to the facility.  She'll be out 2 days before.  Minser not sure what would happen after the program.  Court:  Modify bond while she's at the program.  Convert the bond back when she's done.  We can address bond then.  Belzer:  We can bring discharge papers in and show how well she's done.  Mom says she'sll be flying to CA with her.\n\nCourt comments and address' Abrianna.  The 10,000 cash bond will remain in effect.  Orders $5,000 cash bond on July 7th at 10 am.
