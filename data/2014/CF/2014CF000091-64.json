He was supposed to be paying $100 per month but pays periodically when he can.  Deft says almost 3 years ago, his wife left him.  He is on social security disability.  His ex-wife was bringing in about $3,000 per month in income.  He has a part-time job now - approximately 10 to 20 hours of work every 2 weeks.  He plans on continuing to pay the $100 per month but it has just been hard.  Agent Xiong says he has been doing well on probation.  State is concerned on how little restitution has been paid.  Court extends probation for another 2 years and asks that he pay $100 per month if not more if he can.  Court explains that even if discharged at some point in time, the remaining restitution would be reduced to a civil judgment against the defendant.
