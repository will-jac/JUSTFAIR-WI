Court recites terms of bond requirements and what was to be the Court's intent and the concerns over conducting commerce not under his own identity.  Commerce activity allowed under his own name.  Limitations were also placed upon the marketing of certain products that were manufactured in a manner that had given State rise to concerns over copyright issues and Harley Davidson.  Commentary offered by DA - based upon investigation being undertaken by Det. Olson the bond conditions were well crafted based upon the State's concerns about possible liquidation of any potential evidence.  Commentary offered by Atty Mann - Believes that internet commerce being allowed to continue under \"A Name\" would address the State's concerns.  The Court: Finds the provisions previously imposed as appropriate.  These cases are to be accelerated toward trial.  The Court believes it is appropriate in light of what is alleged in complaint and input from Det. Olson at the previous hearing.  Bond requirements to continue and respectfully declines any amendment.  The Court wants this case moving along to trial at an aggressive rate.  Atty Mann requests one more STC.
