TRANSCRIPT FILED 04-24-2105/tk\nBoth the State and defense have filed bond motions. The State in 14CF588 to adj trial and defense regarding bond modification. The Defense objects to the State's request. \nThe State indicates the issue is the firearm that was allegedly handled by the deft and tossed as he was running from police. Defense asked that the weapon be tested for fingerprints and DNA. Fingerprints were done but DNA was not due to the crime lab's reluctance to test the weapon. The State was able to convince the lab to test same, a swab was taken and it has been submitted to the crime lab. Defense isn't sure they actually asked that it be done but they did inquire. Defense objects to the adjournment citing the length of time deft has been in custody. Deft was granted a signature bond in 14CF588 so he is no longer being held on that matter. If the State's request is granted, Mr. Johnson asks to withdraw due to his limited ability to provide an adequate defense due to his new position.\n\nDefense asks that bonds be modified from cash to just co-signature bonds with deft's mother with the GPS requirement in place. Although defense requested those bonds be converted to cash because deft was going to be held in custody, the deft's mother has not been able to post cash as requested and defense asks that bonds be converted to simply co-signature bonds. The State objects to the bond modification as requested citing the charges deft is now facing.\n\nBTC: The Court believes the State's request for 'touch evidence' is not timely State's request is denied.
