Because there is no adverse decision in this case that Mr. Loga-Negru may seek to review, there is no basis for his motion to waive the copy requirements for a petiton for review.","parties":[],"descr":"Order of the Supreme Court","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-187","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-09-10","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ORD that the motion for reconsideration is denied.","parties":[],"descr":"Order of Court of Appeals","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-186","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-09-04","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ORD that the motion for reconsideration is denied.","parties":[],"descr":"Order of Court of Appeals","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-185","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-08-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"copy of motion to the COA","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-184","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-08-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ORD that this appeal is dismissed in favor of further proceedings in the circuit court.\nFORD that a postconviction motion shall be filed in the circuit court no later than September 28, 2018.","parties":[],"descr":"Court of Appeals decision & order dismissing","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-183","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-08-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ORD that this appeal is dismissed in favor of further proceedings in the circuit court.\nFORD that a postconviction motion shall be filed in the circuit court no later than September 28, 2018.","parties":[],"descr":"Order of Court of Appeals","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-182","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-08-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ORD that the motion to supplement or correct the record on appeal is denied.\nFORD that the appellant's brief shall be filed no later than August 8, 2018.","parties":[],"descr":"Order of Court of Appeals","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-177","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-06-27","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"the motion to enlarge the page limit for the appellant's brief is denied.","parties":[],"descr":"Order of Court of Appeals","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-176","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-06-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Received documents","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-175","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-06-04","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Deadline for trial court to decide postconviction motion extended to 4-2-18","parties":[],"descr":"Order of Court of Appeals","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-174","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-06-01","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"The Record (electronically filed) in the above matter has been filed this date.","parties":[],"descr":"Verification from Court of Appeals","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-178","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-05-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Received documents","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-173","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-05-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Appeals Document Index: 2018AP000730 sent to Court of Appeals by: Samuel A Christensen","parties":[],"descr":"Transmittal of record to court of appeals","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-171","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-05-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Clerk's Certificate of Transmittal","parties":[],"descr":"Certificate of transmittal","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-170","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-05-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Request for copies of documents from Defendant.","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-172","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-05-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ORD that the time for the circuit court clerk to file the record on appeal is extended to June 18, 2018.","parties":[],"descr":"Order of Court of Appeals","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-180","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-05-24","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Received documents","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-169","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-05-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Notice of compilation of record","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-168","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-05-14","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Compilation of record","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-167","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-05-14","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"of postconviction motion held 03-29-2018 (day 2)","parties":[],"descr":"Transcript","amount":null,"key":"51-2014CF001626-166","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-05-11","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"from MPRH held on 03-28-2018 -
