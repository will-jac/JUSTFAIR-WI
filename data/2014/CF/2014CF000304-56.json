Rose in court, in custody.  Sue Mueller appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Court states reasons we are here.  DE wishes to proceed w/o counsel.  Court accepts that.  Motion to revoke DPA on Ct 1 and probation on Cts 2 and 3.  Court questions how any credit DE would have could be applied.  Recess for State to talk about settlement w/DE since he doesn't have counsel.  Back on the record, Court questions DE again re: counsel.  DE says he thought he was going to get a public defender and would now like to speak to one.  Court notes one of the pleas is to a felony and he's concerned about DE representing himself due to that.  DE still wants to represent himself but is wondering how long he would have to wait to get back into court if he gets counsel.  DE decides he does want to proceed today w/o counsel.  State states her understanding as to what will happen today.  She talked to DOC and they are asking two years probation as the drug court recommendations are a minimum of 18 months.  DE states he agrees w/statement by State and he did read the drug court agreement and reviewed that w/the drug court coordinator.  State recommends 6 months jail on Ct 2 and 30 days consecutive on Ct 3.  DE doesn't object to revocation of DPA on Ct and the Court orders DPA revoked on Ct 1 and finds DE guilty on Ct 1.  State recommends two years probation, $518.00, AODA/treatment and any other counseling/treatment recommendations per agent.  Believes DE will be or already has been enrolled in drug court program.  DE is in agreement and has nothing to add.  DE will agree to drug court as a condition of probation.
