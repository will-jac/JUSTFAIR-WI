Defendant Tanner Lee Raymond in custody. Louis J. Molepske appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\n\nContinuation of the Motion hearing: \n\nBY THE COURT:  Regarding the January 8th interview, the Defendant was represented by counsel at the adjourned initial appearance on 12/22 and a prelim was held on 12/29 in which the defendant appeared with attorney Schmidt and the defendant waived his right to preliminary hearing at that time.  The defendant was held and the defendant pleaded not guilty. On 1/6, an amended information was filed.  So the defendant clearly had counsel on 1/8 and he did not request the contact with the police officer.  When the officer retrieved him from the jail and read him his miranda warnings as listed on Ex 5, the defendant waived his right to Miranda and chose to speak without a lawyer present.  Court does wish to have additional briefing on the issue as to whether the defendant effectively waives 6th amendment to counsel at the prelim and arraignment and has not left custody.  Court will give the parties time to do that.  Court is also concerned that discovery was not provided to defense counsel as timely, which would seem appropriate and did hinder defendse counsel preparation for this hearing.  Court will allow counsel to also revisit the issue whether counsel was actually invoked as to whetjer the officer should not have had contact with the defendant without him asking to contact first.  \n\nParties to brief the issue in 2 weeks.  \nBriefs to be filed by both parties regarding the January 8th interview by May 22nd. \nResponse briefs to be filed by both parties by June 5th if they so choose. \nIf the Court did suppress, then it would be what is the suppressed statements and that would be the statements made on January 8th and what is derived from that statement.\nDefendant did voluntarily give a statement on the 8th, whether that's admissable or not or admissable even if the defendant takes the stand to the contrary.  If it was simply a miranda violation, that statement is usually able to be used for impeachment.  Not sure if that is for a 6th amendment violation. \n\nAtty Molepske questions the Court if he waived the 6th amendment and 5th amendment.\nBY THE COURT: Court finds he waived 5th and 6th amendment rights on the January 7th statements.  Court is not convinced he waived his 6th amendment rights on the January 8th date.  \n\nFinal Pre-Trial on 6/8/15 at 10:00.","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"49-2014CF000460-30","ctofc":"Eagon, Thomas B.","date":"2015-05-06","courtRptr":"Sosnowski, Cathy"},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Tanner Lee Raymond in court with attorney Karl Alexander Schmidt.
