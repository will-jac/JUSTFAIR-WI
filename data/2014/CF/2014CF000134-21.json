Court amends count #1 to 961.41(3g)(am). State -- joint recommendation on part and free to argue - probation for 3 years with conditions of: #1 - $500 fine plus costs and surcharges, costs only on other counts, AODA and follow thru, maintain absolute sobriety, no possession of alcohol and no entry into any bars, taverns, or class B establishments, employment/school, 250 hours of community service, take all meds as prescribed by medical provider, reimburse FCDTF (Forest County Drug Task Force) $200.00, argues for 365 days in FC jail and defense to argue for 120 days in FC jail.

Court dismisses and reads in count #4. State makes final argument prior to sentencing - follow joint recommendation and requests 1 year in FC jail - asks for money owed to FCDTF to be paid within a short period of time upon release from incarceration. Sholke makes final argument prior to sentencing - follow joint recommendation - requests 120 days in FC jail - asks for expungement under 973.015 - requests 60 days to report for stated reasons. State objects to allowing the defendant time to report and has no position on expungement. McGeshick makes statement, remorseful.
