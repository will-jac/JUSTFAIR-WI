Agent gives summary as to restitution owed to multiple victims.  When deft makes a payment, it is divided among to all 4 victims.  This year deft has only made one payment of $30.00.  In 2018, he made 5 payments.  Response by Mr. Medina to Court's question as to why he hasn't paid more.  Deft says he has a child and for awhile there, his spouse was not working.
