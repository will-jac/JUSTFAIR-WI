Charles James Simono appeared for the State of Wisconsin. Called at 9:23 AM. State - here for a change of plea. Court reviews plea questionnaire provided by Kennedy, looks like the defendant will be pleading G to counts #1, #5 and #9. State - amend #12 to county ordinance of bail jumping with a $1000 fine plus costs and Kennedy free to argue that it should be inclusive of costs, on counts #1, #5 and #9 - plead G as alleged - not a joint recommendation except for what is being plead to, State requests probation of 3 years to counts #1, #5, and #9, counts #1 and #5 - $500 fine on each plus costs and surcharges and costs only on count #9, conditions: 180 days of conditional jail on count #1 only - no objections to a delayed report time, AODA and follow thru, maintain absolute sobriety, no possession of alcohol and no entry into any taverns, bars or similar class B establishments, employment/school - left to P&P if ordered by the Court, 200 hours of community service, take any all medications as prescribed by medical provider, cost reimbursement of $1360.00 to Forest County Drug Task Force. Kennedy agrees that is what the offer/recommendations would be, has a question about DNA surcharge. State responds. Kennedy makes comment in regards to his recommendation but otherwise what the State said is accurate. State - all other counts needs to be dismissed and read in. Daniels agrees and understands the other counts will be dismissed and read in. Daniels pleads G to counts #1, #5 and #9 as alleged thru attorney. Court amends count #12 to county ordinance of bail jumping. Daniels pleads NC to amended count #12 thru attorney. Court dismisses and reads in all remaining counts. Court finds the defendant guilty of amended count #12. State makes final argument prior to sentencing - reinstates previous recommendations - asking for 6 months of conditional jail time for stated reasons, recommends $500 fine plus costs and surcharges on counts #1, #3 and #5, ask that the money owed to Forest County Drug Task Force be taken first from the bond prior to any other costs. Kennedy states the defendant would like to testify as to why he did what he did - also argues for count #12 's fine to be $1000 inclusive of costs for stated reasons. Court swears the defendant in at 9:51 AM. Defendant takes witness stand. Direct exam by Kennedy. State objects to some of the testimony and direct exam. Court tries to clarify where defense is going. Cross exam by State at 10:02 AM. Daniels excused at 10:04 AM. Daniels makes statement at 10:09 AM.
