Orders PSI - on both cases. Haukaas makes arguement for bond. Family can come with approximately $3600 for bail. State concerned that defendant is here for sentencing state believe should be in lock down facility- state would be willing to stipulate to lock down facility if and when one becomes available and asks court to revoke bond on all cases and remand to jail. Haukaas responds not aware of any lock down facility. Court believes that defendant does need treatment would be willing to go to any treatment facility and may not leave the facility at all and if she would leave facility then she would be breaking her bond. State responds. Court will modify bond to include can go to any treatment facility, however if leaves treatment for any reason then would have to report back to jail immediately and if she doesn't would be further charges and total bond would be $3600 to be applied $500 to case 13CF63 and the remainder amount to case 14CF204. Atty Haukaas to draft paperwork for reduction of bond and state to approve before goes to Judge for signature.
