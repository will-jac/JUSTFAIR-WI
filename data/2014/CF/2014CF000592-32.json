You have bond conditions designed to ensure you are clear of all substances, including alc. The way we make sure that you follow that is thru testing. Missed tests are viewed as pos. You need to communicate w/ JS and if theres an issue ask if you can do something different. I expect you to follow the bond requirements. Possession of meth is serious for it to be a felony. It's highly addictive and it will be important for you to stay clean & sober. If you don't I will have the option of a cash bond. Understand that if I get a violation report, I have 3 choices.... Any more violations, liklihood is OTD will be issued and you will be detained. If you are looking at a diversion, Ms. Hickey will have to determine if you a good candidate for diversion and if you can't comply w/ bond that will have an effect on that determination. \nejs","parties":[],"descr":"Hearing","amount":null,"key":"32-2014CF000592-11","ctofc":"Horne, Scott L","date":"2014-10-08","courtRptr":"Lisney, Kenda"},{"addlTxt":"Justice Sanctions Violations notice, filed.\nSLH: set for hearing","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"32-2014CF000592-10","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-09-25","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Demand for discovery and inspection","amount":null,"key":"32-2014CF000592-7","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-09-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Information","amount":null,"key":"32-2014CF000592-9","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-09-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Responsible court official changed","amount":null,"key":"32-2014CF000592-8","ctofc":"Horne, Scott L","date":"2014-09-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"11:18 am Def in court w/Atty Patricia L.
