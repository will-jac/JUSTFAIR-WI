Defendant Brian E Olds in custody.  Charles James Simono appeared for the Forest, County of. Called at 11:18 AM. Called 13CF124, 14CF03, 15CM100, 16CF63 and 16CF64. State - here for sentencing after revocation on 14CF03 and 13CF124 and here for sentencing hearing on 15CM100, 16CF63 and 16CF64. Voorhees and Olds have revocation summary packet and does not see any inaccuracies. Court notes that the revocation summary is recommending a lengthy term of incarceration - preferrably in prison. Court needs moment to review charges (11:24 AM). State has complied with victim notification requirements with no response. State - summarizes the defendant's criminal history prior to final argument for sentencing - 13CF124 - recommends #1 - 8 years in the WI State Prison System consisting of 4 years of initial confinement followed by 4 years of ES, #2 - 3.5 in WI State Prison System consisting of 1.5 years of initial confinement followed by 2 years of ES - concurrent to count #1; 14CF03 - #3 - 6 years in the WI State Prison System consisting of 3 years of initial confinement followed by 3 years of ES - concurrent to 13CF124; 15CM100 - 90 days jail on each count - concurrent to each other and to 13CF124; 16CF63 - counts #1 and #2 - 3.5 years in the WI State Prison System consisting of 1.5 years of initial confinement followed by 2 years of ES - concurrent to each other but consecutive to 14CF03 and 13CF124; 16CF64 - #2 - 2 years in the WI State Prison System consisting of 1 year of initial confinement followed by 1 year of ES - consecutive to 13CF124, and on counts #3, #5 and #10 - 9 months on each count concurrent to each and to 16CF63 but consecutive to 14CF03 and 13CF124, asking that any restitution/costs be paid by garnishing any of his prison wages/income that he is entitled to. Voorhees makes final argument prior to sentencing recommendation - 13CF124 - calculates jail credit of 444 days  - asking court to consider time served on this case and asks Court to structure any more incarceration time on the new cases, not the revocation cases, calculates 226 days credit on 14CF03 (State stiplulates to defense counsels representation of the facts in 16CF64 and no need to play video - Court agrees) - asking court to not order sex offender registration for stated reasons - recommends a modest period of confinement time and consider consecutive probation on 16CF63 case and an imposed and stayed sentence. Olds makes statement. Court sentences the defendant to the following: Recess until 1:00 PM. Recalled at 1:08 with same appearances. Voorhees makes additional statement in regards to sentences - State is recommending a consecutive prison sentence on the three cases that are being sentenced today. Court comes up with 5.5 years in prison and 6 years of ES, believes that 136CF124, 14CF03 and 15CM100 are concurrent and 16CF63 and 16CF64 are concurrent to each other but consecutive to 13CF124. Court sentences the defendant to the following: 13CF124 - count #1 - 6 years in WI State Prison System consisting of 3 years of initial confinement followed by 3 years of ES, count #2 - 3.5 with 1.5 in and 2 out - concurrent to count #1; 14CF03 - 6 years with 3 in and 3 out - concurrent to counts #1 and #2 on 13CF124; 15CM100 - #3 - 9 months in FC jail and #4 - 9 months in jail - concurrent to each other and to time on 14CF03 and 13CF124; 16CF63 - count #1 - 3.5 years with 1.5 in and 2 out - consecutive to time on 13CF124 and 14CF03 and 15CM100, #2 - 3.5 years with 1.5 in and 2 out - concurrent to count #1; 16CF64 - count #2 - 2 years with 1 in and 1 out - concurrent to time on 16CF63, counts #3, #5 and #10 - 9 months on each count - concurrent to count #1 and concurrent to counts #1 and #2 on 16CF63 and to 13CF124, 14CF03 and 15CM100; any unpaid fines to be paid as condition of ES with other conditions of ES on other counts include:costs - paid thru 25% of any wages/funds he is entitled to, no consumption of alcohol, restitution if submitted, credit for 444 days on 13CF124 (stipulated) - also same credit given on 14CF03 and 15CM100, not eligible for programs, finds crime was sexually motivated but not ordering sex offender registration (16CF63), submit DNA sample with expungement rights given, no possession of firearms, no voting rights. Voorhees believes the defendant is entitled to 226 days credit on 14CF03. Court reviews. Stgate will stipulate to credit as stated by Voorhees. Court - 14CF03 - 226 days credit (stipulated), right to appeal, adjourned at 1:46 PM. Back on record at 1:49 PM, same appearances. Voorhees makes clarification on sentencing and credit.
