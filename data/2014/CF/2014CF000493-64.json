Donohoo appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  \nDefendant Dawn R Kuehni in court with attorney Timothy Mistrioty.  \nAlso present is Probation Agent Amanda Swenson.  \nMatter is before the Court based upon a letter the Court received from Probation Amanda Swenson.  The Agent's concern is with regard to the required monthly payment toward restitution and Ms. Kuehni's inability to pay that amount at this time.  Court did received a letter from Mr. Ghiselli.  Attorney Donohoo states there is no Motion to Modify the sentence that has been filed.  Court agrees that it does not have the authority to do anything at his point.  Statement by Probation Agent Swenson.  The Department does not  feel it is egregious enough to warrant revocation or a jail sanction.  The Dept. reviews all of the defendant's financials and trie to come up with the most realistic way to pay.  The Department does not have that flexability in this case because of the required payments set forth in the Judgment of Conviction.  Ms. Swenson completely understands that the victim wants to be paid and made whole.  Probation Agent Swenson indicates that she has reviewed the letter of victim and indicates there are things in the letter that are not true.  Agent Swenson proposes possibly scheduling a further review hearing in 3 months.  Discussion between Court and Agent as to reason for any probation review heaiing.  DOC is looking for more time and they are doing everything in their power to try to collect the restitution.  Response by Attorney Donohoo.  Response by Attorney Mistrioty that Ms. Kuehni is committed to getting restitution paid within the probation period.  They need 3 to 6 months to get this going.  She was released from Jail in December.  In January she got full time employment.  She brings home just over $--- every two weeks.  When her electronic monitoring ends, there will be more money to apply toward restitution.  She will also be able to work more hours and can look for a 2nd job.  Court believes it it wholly under direction of DOC to determine as to how to proceed.  The Court is encouraged by what Attorney Mistirioty has to say.  Court is not going to take any action at this time but if there is a request by the Dept for sanctions, the court will give it serious consideration.\n2:47 pm  Court in recess.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000493-49","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2016-02-16","courtRptr":"Grzenia, Eileen"},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing at 02-16-2016 02:30 pm","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000493-48","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-02-03","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing at 02-15-2016 08:30 am","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000493-47","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-01-26","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Pro se motion denied - Other","parties":[],"descr":"Motion","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000493-46","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-11-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Pro Se Motion sent to Judge for response -Other--Resubmission with requested documentation","parties":[],"descr":"Request","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000493-45","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-11-25","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Pro se motion denied - Other","parties":[],"descr":"Motion","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000493-44","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-11-11","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Pro Se Motion sent to Judge for response - Other","parties":[],"descr":"Request","amount":null,"key":"64-2014CF000493-43","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-11-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Dawn R Kuehni in court with attorney Timothy Mistrioty.
