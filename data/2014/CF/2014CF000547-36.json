The Court vacates the order to withdraw and indicates that Attorney Wingrove will continue as attorney in this case.\nThe defendant has not made himself available for the competency examination.  The defendant has been living with a lady who threw out his mail and turned off his phone, thats why he didnt show up for his appointment.  Another appointment has been set up for next week.    The parties are asking that bail be modified to include that the defendant must reside with his mother.\nThe Court modifies the conditions of bail to include:\n-that he must reside with his mother, Patty Reznichek, at 908 S. 37th Street, Manitowoc, WI; \n-defendant must cooperate with the Wisconsin Forensic Unit and show up for all scheduled appointments; \n-defendant is to have a working, active phone throughout this case; \n-maintain absolute sobriety and have no possession of any controlled substance unless prescribed by a physician.\nMinutes.\n","parties":[],"descr":"Status conference","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-24","ctofc":"Rohrer, Mark R.","date":"2015-08-27","courtRptr":"Fritz, Denise"},{"addlTxt":"Letter from Dr. Collins to MRR.","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-22","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-07-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Status conference at 08-27-2015 09:15 am","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-21","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-07-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Status conference at 08-27-2015 09:15 am","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-18","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-07-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Hearing is set for 08-26-15 at 3:30 p.m.\nFax cover sheets and note from JA Marcelle.\n","parties":[],"descr":"Order for Competency Examination","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-20","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-07-14","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Attorney Wingrove questions the defendant's competency to proceed in this matter.\nCourt orders a outpatient competency evaluation, but should the defendant not comply he will have an inpatient examination at the county jail until this matter is resolved.\nMinutes.","parties":[],"descr":"Hearing","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-19","ctofc":"Rohrer, Mark R.","date":"2015-06-11","courtRptr":"Fritz, Denise"},{"addlTxt":"Notice of Motion, Motion and Order for Withdraw; Affidavit of Counsel. \nCover letter.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of motion, motion","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-17","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-06-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Settlement Conference Summary.\nPlea hearing is set for 06-11-15 @ 2:30 p.m. BR-1.","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-16","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-04-20","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's Demand for Discovery and Inspection.","parties":[],"descr":"Demand for discovery","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-15","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-03-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Charles Wingrove, through Public Defender.","parties":[],"descr":"Public defender order appointing counsel","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-14","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-03-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Settlement Conference Summary.\nSettlement conference with District Attorney is reset to 04-16-15 at 4:00 p.m.","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-13","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-03-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion to Authorize Counsel of Record to Withdraw; Order Authorizing Counsel to Withdraw as Attorney of Record.  \nCover Letter.","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-12","ctofc":"Rohrer, Mark R.","date":"2015-03-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Settlement Conference Summary.\nSettlement conference with District Attorney is reset to 03-12-15 at 2L30 p.m.","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-11","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-02-24","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Settlement conference with District Attorney reset to 02-24-15 at 1:30 p.m.","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-10","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-02-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's Discovery Demand","parties":[],"descr":"Demand for discovery and inspection","amount":null,"key":"36-2014CF000547-9","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-01-14","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant waives his right to a preliminary hearing.
