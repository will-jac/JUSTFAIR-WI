Def in custody.  Edward Minser appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\n\nWright asks the Court to consider a sig. bond or a lower cash bond of $1,000.  Mr. Elmore's been in jail since March 4th.  He's lived in this area for 15 years and attended school here.  He's lived in the same trailer for 6 years.  Several family here including his mother.  There are here today in support of him.  He cooperated with the police.  Asks for a chance at a reasonable bail for what he's being exposed.  The facts are pretty plain here.  He has no reason to plea or is it practable for him to go anywhere else.  Family can not post $5,000.  Minser feels the bond that's currently set is reasonable.  He doesn't have the right to the amount that the famly can post.  Sites 969.01(4) and that's what sets out consideration for what the bail should be.  The Court has to look at the penalties and facts of the complaint and other circumstances...  It's not just what he can post and his ties here.  The State  has a very strong case.  The Court found bind over.  There's DNA.  The Court has already reduced bail here that's a gift to him.\n\nCOURT comments.  Serious offense.  Compass was done.  Risks are high and medium.  The State has a strong case.  Possibility of prison.  The $5,000 is reasonable. THE CASH BOND WILL REMAIN.
