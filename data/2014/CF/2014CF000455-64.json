Attorney Donohoo had met with her in September of 2015.  Attorney Donohoo believes she is a key witness but her only concern is that because of her ties to the defendant and the victim, she may be a reluctant witness.

Attorney Donohoo indicates if the witness doesn't appear on Monday by 8:30 a.m., she will be asking for a material witness warrant.  Attorney Donohoo believes she will have 4 to 5 witnesses at most.
