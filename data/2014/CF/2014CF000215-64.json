Court believes testimony is necessary.  Atty Johnson is prepared to proceed today.  Attorney Schwantes apologizes for not being able to secure Dr. Thompson's appearance here today.  Attorney Schwantes makes record with regard to the time it took to retain Dr. Thompson and for him to prepare his report.  Dr. Thompson is not available until the week of trial.  Court indicates that potentially we could hear the Motion hearing on June 15 or 16 when the Doctor is available if the Court's other trials that week resolve or if only a 2-day trial goes.  Court notes if the trial is reset, it would be heard by Judge Drettwan.  Attorney Johnson's preference would be that the Judge who tries the case would also hear the Motion.  Attorney Schwantes will defer to the Court as to how to proceed.  Court will take the matter off the trial calendar for June 13th and will keep it on for the pre-trial to find out what other case is going to trial. the week of June 13th.  Court will excuse the Defendant from appearing at the final pre-trial.  Attorney Schwantes can be available by phone for the final pre-trial or Attorney Frank Raff can appear on his behalf.  Court has no problem with Attorney Raff appearing at the final pre-trial on behalf of Atty Schwantes.  Court asks counsel if the trial will be longer than the 4 days currently set if Dr. Thompson is allowed to testify?  Attorneys believe 5 days would be sufficient for trial.  Court reschedules final pre-trial and Jury trial dates.
