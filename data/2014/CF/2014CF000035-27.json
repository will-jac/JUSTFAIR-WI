DA Gerald Fox appears for the State.  DA Fox clarifies that Counts 1 & 2 are sentencing after revocation and Count 3 is to be sentenced.  Fox also requests the restitution amount be amended to $13,175.00; states there is 391 days jail credit.  Attorney Gardner has no objection to the change in restitution and agrees with the amount of jail credit.  State recommends 9 months jail on Count 1 and 90 days on Count 2 consecutive to Count 1, with credit for 270 days resulting in being sentenced to time served on both counts.  Recommendation on Count 3 is 3 years probation and all recommended programming must be completed and must report to probation immediately.  Defense has no objection to recommendation by the State.  Defendant speaks.  Court adopts the joint recommendation as follows:  Count 1 sentenced to 9 months with credit for time served; Count 2 sentenced to 90 days with time served.  Costs are Counts 1 & 2 are coverted to civil judgment with the amended restitution amount being added onto Count 3.  Sentence on Count 3:  Sentence withheld and placed on probation for 3 years with following conditions:  Must call probation at (715) 284-4747 within 1 hour of release from jail and must report immediately.  If released after office hours then must call no later than 9:00 a.m. the following day.
