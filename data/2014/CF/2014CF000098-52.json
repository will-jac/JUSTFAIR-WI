Murray in court, in custody, with attorney Lisa A. McDougal. Prosecuting Atty Jennifer M. Harper appeared for State of Wisconsin.  Several cases called together:\n\n14CF95, 14CF96, 14CF97, 14CF98, 14CF99/initial.  DA asks for $10000 signature bond in each case; notes def is presently in the prison system and will be for the next two years.  DA notes that she received a speedy dispo request from the def on Monday - request wasn't signed and wasn't received by the clerk.  Atty. M states she was made aware of the request when it was forwarded to her by DA Harper.  Atty. M states that def made the request not understanding what it was for; thought that having pending cases affected his ability to be released.  \n\nDef waives formal reading of the complaints in all five cases.  Court states the charges and informs def of the possible max. penalties.  In some of these cases, def has been charged as a repeater with that as well as the party-to-the-crime enhancers stated.\n\nAt this point, def enters NG plea to the misdemeanor count in 14CF98.  DA notes that the single count in 14CF98 is a misdemeanor; case was filed as a felony due to DA's office error.  DA states that, rather than having the error corrected at this point, she'd ask that the matter remain as listed; may resolve when the others matters resolve.\n\nAtty. M states that def will waive his right to prelim in the four felony cases; requests arraignment in those matters and status in 14CF98 which is actually a misdemeanor.  Feb. 25 at 1:30.\n\nDA requests 10k signature bond with no contact conditions as stated on the record.  Def to be booked on all of these cases.\n\nAtty. M asks for Court's colloquy with Def that the request he made was not a speedy trial demand.  Court conducts a speedy trial colloquy with def.  Def states he filed his request after the prison system came to him and stated that he could be moved to a min-security facility with treatment; that's why he send the paperwork; he did it before he'd talked with his attorney; didn't know it was going to interfere; states parole board said they'd see him in May; possibility for treatment might not come up in another six months to a year.  Def states he's not in min-security right now because of these open charges; felt pressured at the time he made the requests to make them for the reasons he has stated.  Atty. M states def was only doing what was recommended by the records dept to expedite way to treatment facility.
