Lewandowski in custody and in court via video means, with Attorney James McLaughlin on behalf of Attorney Michael C Hoffman.  John M Yackel appeared for the State of Wisconsin.    Defendant advised of rights/penalties, acknowledges receipt of complaint.  Attorney McLaughlin argued motion to modify bond, argued DE had no criminal history and has strong ties to Hayward.  State argues does not want to change bond as it leaves no protection for public, there are more than 10 victims and high likelihood DE would be a flight risk to leave jurisdiction considering the pending charges.  Rebuttal---he was arrested while in the community, not in flight, and our court system hinges on a presumption of innocence.  \n\nCourt modified bond to $10,000 bond ($3,000 cash component, $7,000 signature component) with conditions of: NO CONTACT with any person under 18 years of age, no computer access, DE must not be in possession of a computer, and DE shall not access the internet through any device.
