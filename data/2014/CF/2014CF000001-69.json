Per Atty Wallace:  Report has been reviewed with the Defendant, no objection to findings of report.  Def states he will want to challenge report findings and requests to see another doctor.  Atty Wallace confers with his client to confirm he understands findings of report received.  Based upon challenge offered by the Defendant, 2nd evaluation will be requested by Atty Wallace.  Per DA:  Doctor was relieved from this hearing today due to anticipated Stipulation as to findings.  Def agrees he disagrees with the current report findings and advises counsel of same.  Appointment of a subsequent evaluator as per statute is discretionary.  Court declines to appoint 2nd psychiatrist or psychologist and finds it appropriate to contemplate the body of information included in reports.  Court construes Def's position of a denial of his competency placing burden on the State by clear and convincing evidence.
