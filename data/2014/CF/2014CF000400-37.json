When a juvenile is\n    charged in a court of criminal jurisdiction, the court can transfer the\n    case to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court if the court finds all of\n    the following: 1) If convicted, the juvenile could not receive adequate\n    treatment in the criminal justice system; 2) Transferring jurisdiction to\n    the court assigned to exercise juvenile jurisdiction would not depreciate\n    the seriousness of the offense; and 3) Retaining jurisdiction is not\n    necessary to deter the juvenile or other juveniles from committing the\n    violation of which the juvenile is accused.\n  </p><p data-section-name=\"notice\">\n    <strong>Notice to employers:</strong> It may be a violation of state law to\n    discriminate against a job applicant because of an arrest or conviction\n    record.
