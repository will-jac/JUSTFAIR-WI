Hearing started at 1:40 p.m.  Motion for return of property.  Atty Haukaas requests property seized at the time of arrest.  DA objects to hearing; motion filed 14CV80.  That matter has not been resolved yet, 2 days ago amended motion to add these two criminal cases.  Subpoena of Witnesses not prepared/mailed; only given 2 days notice.  State asserts the property was in maintaining a drug house; cash on list of property to return.  Judge asks for 14CV80 case.  Break taken for Clerk to retrieve file.  After review of file, Court takes notice of the civil file; assigned to Judge Robert Eaton.  Civil case does have a scheduling order signed by Judge Eaton, questions Atty Haukaas why he should hear the motion today?  Atty Haukaas responds; scheduled with Judge's JA.  Court again questions why motion should be heard today?  Atty Haukaas indicated the civil case does not include the personal property, only the defendant's vehicle.  DA argues the original motion filed with civil case number.  Seeking return of two firearms and defendant is a convicted felon.  Seeking return of pills and paraphernalia; need more info.  Atty Haukaas indicates NOH with language on what will be heard today.  Seeking return of money, telephone, blackberry, one firearm belongs to brother and the second firearm turned over to sister, money bundles and safety deposit keys.  Court;$1577.00.  DA would like to do a background check on siblings willing to take firearms.
