Attorney Necci argues the Court has the power to determine its discretion at this point.  Attorney Breffeilh agrees. Court did rely upon the Statute and did not believe it had any discretion at the time.  Argument by Ms. Hahn.  State is arguing for a single surcharge to be assessed.  Attorney Breffeilh indicates that Mr. Ecklund may have given a previous DNA sample and been assessed the surcharge.  Continued discussion between Court and Attorneys.  If he has paid the surcharge, the State is not asking that he pay it again.  DA Necci indicates that if he has provided a sample in the past, the State is not asking for a surcharge.  Attorney Breffeilh advises the Defendant has prior convictions and believes he has likely given a sample and been assessed the surcharge.  Clerk checks CCAP records.  The Defendant has been ordered to give a DNA sample and has previously paid the DNA surcharge on another case.  Defendant's Motion is GRANTED and the DNA surcharge on this case will be vacated.
