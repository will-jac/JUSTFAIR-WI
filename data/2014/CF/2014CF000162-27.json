Defense stipulates to facts in the complaint and agrees there is a factual basis for his pleas.  State recommends 3 years probation with conditions as stated in agreement:  restitution; no contact with L.S. or B.F.; maintain employment, must undergo a risk and needs assessment and must comply with any conditions recommended which may include anger mangagmen;  no drugs or paraphernalia; AODA assessment and must follow all recommendations;  no alcohol consumption or be where available.

Court accepts the pleas and finds him guilty of charges plead to.  Defense agrees to terms of probation but requests a 2 1/2 years probation term rather than 3 years.  Defendant does not speak on his behalf.  Court orders 3 years probation concurrent with probation now serving but after 30 months he may apply for early discharge if no new charges/convictions.
