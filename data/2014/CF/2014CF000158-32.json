Barton.  Def in custody.  Edward Minser appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\n\nBarton's motion on bond.  Minser addresses Def.'s statutory right for a speedy trial.  Not a reason for release.  It's not absolute.  It's not appropriate to release the Def. because of delays.  The delays are of the Def.'s own actions.  Motions were filed in court in May and the State didn't have time to respond.  Further delays were caused by the Def. and Co-Def.'s.  He's not shown any prejudice.  No miscarrage of justice.  Court asks Mr. Minser to focus on the medical issues.  I agree that there's no automatic.  The issue is can I maintain him in the community safely.  Minser sites bail statute.  Understands the Court is concerned about the Def.s health.  The Def. is receiving meds. in the jail.  I attempted to contact probation and parole but their office is closed today.  He was on em when he picked up these charges.  That's says he's not a good risk out on bond even with house arrest.  The Def. really hasn't shown enough why he should be out in the community.  Barton informs the Court that Mr. Jones signed an ATR on Friday which calls for 6 mos. on house arrest.  The Dept. did that largely based upon his medical conditions.  He's deteriorated significantly in a months time.  He lost 70 lbs in a couple of weeks and almost died.  He's been given meds in the jail.  The Sheriff's Dept. is concerned.  None of these charges are death penalty charges.  They are significant and we do understand that.  The Dept. has verified the address he'd be staying at.\nCOURT:  I want to know if the DOC is considering any credit on that house arrest.  I want to know where he'd be living and how he'll be monitored.  I can reduce the cash bond but I need more information.  I won't change the bond today.","parties":[],"descr":"Bail/bond hearing","amount":null,"key":"32-2014CF000158-26","ctofc":"Gonzalez, Ramona A.","date":"2014-07-23","courtRptr":"Frydenlund, Amy"},{"addlTxt":"Response to Defendant's Motions to Sever and Response to Defendant's Motions to Ientify Confidential Informant, filed","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"32-2014CF000158-25","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-06-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion hearing on September 9, 2014 at 09:00 am.\r\nJury selection on October 27, 2014 at 08:45 am.\r\nJury trial on October 28, 2014 at 08:45 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"32-2014CF000158-23","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-06-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"CRT: Motion to Sever is Denied\nAny agreements will be disclosed at the same time you disclose witness list, which is 5 weeks prior to trial\nJS: 10-27-14 - Pick and Go from 10-24-14 thru 11-05-14.\nMotions will be heard on 09-09-14 at 9:00am - all day","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"32-2014CF000158-24","ctofc":"Gonzalez, Ramona A.","date":"2014-06-06","courtRptr":"Frydenlund, Amy"},{"addlTxt":"in support of Motion to identify Confidential Informant","parties":[],"descr":"Memorandum","amount":null,"key":"32-2014CF000158-22","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-05-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"to identify Confidential Informant","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of motion, motion","amount":null,"key":"32-2014CF000158-21","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-05-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"From: Branch I to Jail Re: may be sig bond of $50,00 w/cond to return to jail upon release from hospital","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"32-2014CF000158-20","ctofc":null,"date":"2014-05-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Barton filed Motion to Sever - other Attorney's will be filing Motions to Sever.\nMinser requests to hear all motions to sever at the same time.\nCRT: All Motions to Sever must be filed no later than close of business on 05-16-14.\nMotion Hearing: 06-06-14 at 2:30pm w/RAG - rest of the day\nMinser - State will not object to the Severance with Ms Davis.\nCRT: As to Tyler Davis - Teh Motion to Sever is GRANTED, internal review 06-20-14.  \nGuth comments\nCRT: You can file your motion Mr Guth.\nCRT: At the next hearing Court will expect counsel for Mr Jones, Rogers.
