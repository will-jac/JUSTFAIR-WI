Defendant Alicia A Rushing in custody.  Gerad T Dougvillo appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Court Reporter: Patricia Schaefer.\nParties are looking into having deft enter into drug Court. Mr. Hamad got a drug court offer from ADA Wishau. Deft needs to be evaluated and her participation needs to be voted on. The State concurs. Defense asks for cash bond to be converted to $500.00 cash and a co-signature bond with her monther, Susan Ann Ball, 12/3/1961.\nThe State objects to bond modification to the extend proposed. The State believes more than $500.00 is necessary. The drug court offer is asking for 150 days in RCJ. If deft is released, she would have to report right back in jail should her drug court offer be accepted.\n\nBTC: Bond modification is granted.
