DA asks for $10000 signature bond in each case; notes def is presently in the prison system and will be for the next two years.  DA notes that she received a speedy dispo request from the def on Monday - request wasn't signed and wasn't received by the clerk.  Atty.

DA notes that the single count in 14CF98 is a misdemeanor; case was filed as a felony due to DA's office error.  DA states that, rather than having the error corrected at this point, she'd ask that the matter remain as listed; may resolve when the others matters resolve.\n\nAtty.

Def states he's not in min-security right now because of these open charges; felt pressured at the time he made the requests to make them for the reasons he has stated.  Atty.
