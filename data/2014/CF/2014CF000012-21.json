Court questions Joy if he has the documents. Joy does have the certificates and wasn't sure if he was to send them to the court. Shepard continues, he has volunteered in Green Bay for his community service. Court does not have that information in file. Joy makes statement. Court questions why defendant is still in prison as sentence was 4 years of incarceration and 3 years of extended supervision. Joy indicates there was a case in Brown County that was consecutive. State confirms. Joy makes final argument, if he would have been made eligible for programming he may have then had it completed by now and asks the court to reconsider the sentence adjustment filed by Shepard.
