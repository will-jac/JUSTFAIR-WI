Vorhees has discussed PH with client and has signed waiver which is provided to court. Court goes thru waiver and finds that defendant is waiving his right to PH, freely, voluntarily and intelligently, accepts waiver, finds probable cause and binds over. INFO will be filed which will mirror complaint by adding party to a crime. Vorhees not sure court can take plea. Vorhees provides consent to consolidation to court. Court believes that defendant will have to be brought here for ARGN. Vorhees believes that INFO must be filed here. State intends to dismiss one count here after sentenced in Oconto Co. Vorhees believes that other count will be DRI in Oconto Co case. Court still believes that if pleading to 1 count in Oconto then would have to have ARGN here on the count that is not being prosecuted in Oconto County. Court doesn't have a problem doing a plea by phone as it appears that he will be pleading not guility. Proceed to ARGN pleads NG to the charges. Case to be consolidated with Oconto Co.
