She advises that he is due to discharge tomorrow.  She advises that Deft is refusing to sign the extension.  Atty Leusink says that the State did reach out to the victim.  Court does not believe deft has made a good faith effort to pay and orders a 2 year extension of probation.  Court would consider reopening if deft insists on having a hearing.  Court advises Agent that she needs to prepare paper work extending Mr. Schiessl's probation.  9:36 am  Court in recess.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000122-41","ctofc":"Koss, Phillip A.","date":"2019-08-01","courtRptr":"Elderbrook, Sandy"},{"addlTxt":"Letter from Prob Agent with attachments, re:  prob. review hearing;","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000122-40","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-07-20","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing on August 1, 2019 at 09:30 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000122-39","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-06-07","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Notice of court ordered financial obligations","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000122-38","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-05-01","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Records of prosec. are converted data.

Case called.  Appearances given.  \nADA Diane M. Donohoo appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  \nDefendant Michael M. Schiessl in court, in custody.  \nProbation Agent Kristine Evers is present by telephone.  \nMatter is on today for a probation review hearing.  Defendant was placed on probation 2 years and probation is due to expire on August 13th of this year.  Defendant stopped reporting to probation and was in absconder status as of March 28, 2016 - he was arrested on November 25, 2016 and has been in custody since that time.  Agent Evers makes record as to defendant's multiple cases both in Waukesha County and Milwaukee County.  Defendant is serving a sentence now out of Waukesha County and has Huber privileges on that case.  Response by Agent to Court's question as to why defendant's probation case wasn't revoked on this case?  DOC's intent is to just let this case run.  8:37 am  Response by Atty Donohoo that the State objects to allowing defendant's probation to discharge.  Victim has confirmed that he has not received any restitution whatsoever.  Atty Donohoo is asking for a 2 year extension of Mr. Schiessl's probation.  He has not made a good faith effort.  8:38 am  Statement by Ms. Schiessl that he has been in custody for last 10 months without huber so he couldn't make any payments.  Statement by Mr. Schiessl that he has a broken back and a seizure issue happening now.  8:39 am  Response by Agent that defendant has been in custody for most of the time that he has been on probation.  If extended, Agent believes he will be in jail for the entire 2 years of the extension.  Court makes record as to how this looks from Walworth County's prospective.  Court cannot find that he has made any kind of good faith effort to pay back his restitution.  He was in absconder status for a long time.  Court orders a 2 year extension of defendant's probation.  DOC is to prepare an order to that effect for Court's signature.  8:42 am  Court in recess.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000122-35","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2017-07-27","courtRptr":"Matoska, Linda"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Order to produce","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000122-34","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-07-11","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing on July 27, 2017 at 08:30 am.  \nCopy of Notice of hearing was also mailed to Mr. Schiessl at the Waukesha County Jail, PO Box 0217, Waukesha, WI  53187-0217","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000122-32","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-06-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"5-30-2017 - E-mail from Prob.
