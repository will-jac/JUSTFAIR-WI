The parties agreed to have the hearing conducted remotely under the Standing COVID-19 Order requirements. This hearing has met the statutory standards for video conferencing.  Case called for oral ruling on Defendant's Postconviction Motion.  Court also notes it needs to address Defendant's Motion to Suspend Court Fees Until Release as well as a letter filed by the defendant back on 02/04/2020.  Court will first address the defendant's letter filed on 02/04/2020 and notes that it should have been resolved by the amended JOC that was signed back in January.  Defendant advises that he is still having issues with getting visits with Ms. Myhre.  The Court finds that as 19CF339 was dismissed and read into this case and therefore closed the no contact order in that case with Ms. Myhre is now moot.  Court will prepare an order to that effect to make sure that the defendant is able to have visits with Ms. Myhre.  Court will next address Defendant's Motion to Suspend Court Fees Until Release.  For reasons placed on the record the Court denies the motion to suspend court fees until release.  Court will next address Defendant's Postconviction Motion.  Court places its findings on the record.  For reasons placed on the record the Court grants Defendant's Postconviction Motion.  Court will order the defendant entitled to a resentencing hearing.
