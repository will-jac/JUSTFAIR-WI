Atty Rashid does not see any need for court to address competency.  Atty Rashid requests second eval be undertaken by Dr. Frank Cummings.  State objected to Dr. Cummings performing second eval.  Atty Rashid confirms that Dr. Cummings can perform said eval and treated as a sub sec (2) eval.  DA has no objection to the Court ordering a second eval but would object to that eval being performed by Dr. Cummings, State believes the appointment should be random and from a neutral detached doctor, not hand picked by defense.  Court notes that Dr. Cummings is not on the independent evalutor listing.  Further argument by Atty Rashid as to second eval - SPD will not pay for the second eval as ordered.  States problems that exist with the first eval of Dr. Collins and believes that Dr. Cummings could provide a sub section (2) eval that is neutral.  Def deserves a fair evaluation.
