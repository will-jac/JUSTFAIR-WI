Def in custody.  Emily E. Hynek appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\nO'Neill:  She's served her previous time.  The only thing holding her in jail now is the 2 cash bonds.  These 2 cases are set for a plea.  She's had 80 days of sobriety.  Her record is mostly misdemeanor based.  It's not a terrible record.  She would live with her mother on Brice Prairie.  No obj. to JSS monitoring.  She has 2 children who are being taken care of by her mother.  Her mother has cancer and is dying.  She's been on JSS before and did not violated.  Asks for a sig. bond.  It's set for a plea but we don't have anything definitively worked out.  COURT:  Has there been a compass report?  O'Neill:  No.  COURT:  Monitoring is one thing but with no treatment plan, it's setting her up for failure.  O'Neill:  She had an assessment on probation and that showed she was dependent.  There's no reason she can't do it again.  Hynek:  It's true her history is all misdemeanors but she was revoked off probation.  Given her drug addiction, I have concerns with her ability to be out in the communit without a set plan being in place.  I'm not taking a strong position but if shs'e released, I'd ask for house arrest and drug testing.\nCOURT:  I'd like JSS to have a treatment plan such as the on as part of probation.  Once I have that, I'll reduce it to a $1,000 sign bond with the condition that she follow the treatment plan she had on probation.  JSS monitor house arrest and drug testing.  No alcohol or controlled substances w/o Rx from a Dr.  She's to sign any releases so that JSS can verify any compliance.\nCourt addresses Ms. Dolan.\ne-jss","parties":[],"descr":"Bail/bond hearing","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000075-11","ctofc":"Horne, Scott L","date":"2015-03-30","courtRptr":"Stello, Michelle"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000075-10","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-03-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Judicial transfer","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000075-9","ctofc":"Tlustosch, Candice C.M.","date":"2015-02-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Information","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000075-8","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-02-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Responsible court official changed","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000075-7","ctofc":"Pasell, Dale","date":"2015-02-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"11:01 am - Def in court w/ Atty Sean William O'Neill.
