Nelson in court with Attorney Steven W. Zaleski.  ADA Jeffrey Shock appears for the State of Wisconsin.  \nThis case is scheduled for Final Status/Scheduling Conference today and for Jury Trial next week, however ADA Shock summarizes a plea-agreement that has been reached by the parties; this agreement includes Mr. Nelson entering pleas on two amended charges and then a conviction on the misdemeanor count and entry into a deferred prosecution agreement on the felony count. \nThe State files an Amended Information. \nService of the Amended Information is admitted. The Court recites the charges and maximum penalties.  \nConstitutional rights are reviewed.\nADA Shock verifies victim rights compliance; the victim and the victim's family members are present. \nPleas of \" Guilty \" are entered on Counts #1 & #2; factual basis is stipulated.\n\nAs to Count #1: the Court accepts the plea, finds Mr. Nelson guilty, and orders Judgment of Conviction entered.\nAs to Count #2: the Court accepts the plea, finds Mr. Nelson guilty; the Court stays the Judgement for 27 months under the Deferred Prosecution Agreement.\n\nDuring the Count #1-Sentencing portion of the hearing the victim C.J.J. makes a statement. \n\nOn Count #1 the Court withholds sentence and places Mr. Nelson on Probation for 24 months, with conditions:\n--to serve 90 days in Jefferson County Jail, with Huber [Work Release] privileges; to commence on November 11th by 7:00pm. \n--to undergo any treatment, therapy or counseling as required by the Agent \n--to obtain/maintain employment and an educational program per the Agent\n--to provide a DNA sample unless one has already been provided\n--to pay costs of $443; this is to be paid as a condition of Probation [the Court does not order payment through the Clerk of Courts Office because payment of costs is a requirement of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement] \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn Count #2 the Court affirms that it is staying the Judgment for 27 monthes; the Court places the burden on the State to file a motion to dismiss before the 27 month period lapses. \nThe Court requires Sex Offender Regristration per the Deferred Prosecution Agreement.  The Court clarifies that it is not requiring this Sex Offender Registration to be a life-long requirement. Futher if the Court and counsel are mis-reading the law in relation to the 15 year-minimum reporting period, then the Court would entertain a motion to reduce that time.  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDays credit for time already served given: 0 days.\nThe Court clarifies to Mr. Nelson that the Bond and conditions continue while Mr. Nelson is under the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The Court reviews with Mr. Nelson the Bond-condition that he is not to have any direct or indirect contact with C.J.J. \nrecess 11:40am","parties":[],"descr":"Plea hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000394-97","ctofc":"Weston, Jennifer L","date":"2017-10-31","courtRptr":"Schueler, Erica L."},{"addlTxt":"JA's review of RUMS","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000394-96","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-08-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Joshua T.
