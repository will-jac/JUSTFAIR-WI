DA Wm. Norine in Court.  Court advises Erin she has right to have attorney for bail hearing in criminal cases, she wishes to proceed alone for bail hearing.  Court asks Erin why she didn't show up for Court on July 6th.  She wasn't around and wasn't aware she had court on July 6th.  She appeared on June 22nd and she was given notice of the next hearing.  Erin uses Eagle Feather Drive as her address but wasn't allowed to stay there.  She is currently under a $2500 signature bond.  DA is not comfortable with straight signature bond due to the case type and lack of appearances.  This is not the first time she has failed to appear, there is a bail jump in 15 CF 71.  Court orders:  under $2500 signature bond, converted to $2500 cash.  Key to get out is:  allow her to be released from custody without any cash whatsoever so long as it is going into a treatment center approved by the Dept., Fahrman, Keystone, Hazelden, anywhere else, provided that she completes it succussfully and reports back to the jail once it is completed.
