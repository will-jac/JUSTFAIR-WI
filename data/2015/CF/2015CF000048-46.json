Court confirms defendant received copy of criminal complaint, advises of charges/max. penalties, felony prohibitions if convicted.  Advised of constitutional rights.  He's sitting on $1000 cash bond, no bond on earlier cases, there's $1000 cash bond sitting there and now a new violation.  State won't request an increase cash bond, he's represented, he's local.  Court notes cash bond can be considered after a bond has been a violation.  I'm like to impose an addt'l cash bond.  Atty Randtke asks at this bond to leave the bond as is.  Court concerned with bail jumping charge with violation date in July, cash bond was set on that charge and then a new bail jumping case in September violation alleges continued use of controlled substance, it involves a use of motor vehicles with at least a detectable amount of that controlled substance which poses a direct risk to public; $1000 cash bond not sufficient, set addt'l cash bond of $3000 in addition to the $1000 that is posted.  The state will consider whether to revoke the $1000 cash bond.  You are remitted to PCSD until bond is posted.   Mr. Randtke requests P.H.
