Drinkwater in court with attorney Adam Raabe.  Defendant Dale D. Drinkwater in custody.  Linda Ann Hoffman appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Court states case and parties state appearances.  Court notes motions filed and letter rec'd on 10/14 from Atty Hoffman.  Atty Raabe states he never received this letter.  Court goes off the record so Atty Raabe can review the letter.  Back on the record, Court questions whether A.F. will be testifying as she is named in several motions.  Atty Raabe withdraws motions 1 through 4, 11, 14 through 16.  Atty Raabe states how he's going to handle the testimony now through cross-exam rather than calling his own witnesses.  State objects to learned treatises being used as Atty Raabe intends and explains why.  Court responds re: what was discussed at prior motion hearing.  Atty Raabe responds.  Court grants defense motion 12 w/understanding that he will not allow jury to pour over these documents to determine what they mean.  DE motion paragraph 5 and 6 covered by a State's motion.  Court addresses DE motion 8.  State responds.  Atty Raabe responds.  State to provide any \"screen shots\" to Atty Raabe prior to trial so they may be redacted if necessary.  Court will grant motion as to any searches that may prejudice the jury in re: to material that was searched that may reflect stalking behavior.  Court addresses images not turned over.  Atty Raabe requests State not be allowed to display any images not charged in this matter.  State responds/they intend to reference other images but unsure if they will use them at this point.  Parties argue.  Court instructs if a document/photo is legal for the normal man to possess then copies would need to be provided to Atty Raabe.  Atty Raabe asks re: providing copies of such documents to the DE.  Court will not direct parties in that respect as that is up to the DE to know what the DE can and cannot have in his possession.  Court addresses DE motion 13.  State believes thats already been addressed.  Atty Raabe responds.  Court grants 13.  That is the end of the DE motions except for companion motions to the State's motion.  Atty Raabe notes #7 - requests it be admitted as admissible hearsay.  Court questions nec-mec report.  State responds re: identification.  Atty Raabe responds.  Parties discuss.  Court doesn't think he'll be able to decide this today on the fly.  Court will rule on this the morning on trial.  Atty Raabe to make decision and provide that to the State by Monday.  Court addresses expert testimony.  Atty Raabe no longer intends on calling any experts to that motion would be moot.  State is in agreement re: expert being able to date photos.  Documents to be turned over by noon or Dr. Hendricks would not be allowed to testify per agreement.  Parties discuss rebuttal expert.  Any expert name to be provided to State by Monday.  Atty Raabe to address expert re: her age analysis.  Parties discuss Atty Raabe showing a passport to the expert.  State objects.  Parties argue.  Court questions which of the original 17 have been dismissed.  Atty Raabe is intending to question witness on #10, 11 and 12, which are the ones that have been dismissed from the original 17.  State notes #15 is also not charged.  Parties argue.  Court will not rule as he will have to see how that plays out at trial.  May need sidebar or excuse jury if necessary.  Atty Raabe states he wants to be allowed to question officer as to why some photos were originally charged and are no longer being charged.  State objects/trial w/in a trial.  Court advises Atty Raabe what he will not allow during closing arguments.  Atty Raabe responds.  Court affirms his prior statement.  Court address website searches done previously.  Atty Raabe doesn't object as those charges have now been dismissed.  State still wants the motion granted.  Court holds matter open in case it comes up.  Other acts evidence addressed in letter dated 10/14/2016.  State moves to admit conviction, pre-teen model search and presence of same images.  Atty Raabe notes discovery he just received today from the DA's office.  Has concern re: disc he just received today as to the search.  Computer from Col Co case has never been turned over to him so that is a discovery issue.  Court notes these offenses allow the greater latitude rule to apply.  Court notes he will not allow any videos involving children performing sexual acts.  Court addresses the issue of DE being on supervision and how the search happened due to his condition of not to have a computer.  Court grants the State's motion but in the limited fashion he's described as to images/search terms described in 10/14/16 correspondence from Atty Hoffman.  State makes argument as to erotica on this case re: the uncharged images.  Court questions.  Atty Raabe responds.  State responds.  Break at 11:04 a.m.  Back on the record at 11:15 a.m.  Court notes for purposes of the record re: other acts analysis and what he was thinking.  State is done re: child erotica.  Court addresses further the images of lewd display.  Court finds State has met first two prongs of the Sullivan analysis.  Court will allow certain child erotica images.  State believes anything they would introduce would fall into the child erotica category.  Court again advises State to provide those to Atty Raabe.  State notes discovery is accessible to Atty Raabe just like it is for anyone else.  Court again reviews DE motions.  Number 5 - Columbia Co conviction will be allowed.  State notes there would be 13 prior convictions if the DE chooses to testify.  Atty Raabe is unsure of correct number as of today.  States there is a chance the DE will testify.  Court orders State to provide Atty Raabe by noon on Monday the list of prior convictions and then Atty Raabe can notify the Court if there is a problem w/that.  No other convictions other than Columbia Co will be testified to.  DE motion 6 is denied.  DE motion 10 is granted w/the proviso that the State may introduce images of uncharged images per his prior ruling.  Court believes all motions have been heard now at this time.  Court notes on 10/27/2016 he has a day set aside for a contested divorce, suggests they meet again at 3:30 on 10/27/16 for any unresolved issues.  Proposed jury instructions to be filed by 10/27/2016 also.  Atty Raabe makes statement re: subpeonas.  State was planning on using individual pages and then publishing them to the jury.  Atty Raabe would agree w/that process.  Atty Raabe states he'll need the \"elmo\".  Court requests no charged images to be put on the screen.  Atty Raabe addresses discovery just rec'd re: statement DE made.  State doesn't intend to use written statements but would use statement made to agent.  Atty Raabe is in agreement.  Anything further to be filed by Monday.
