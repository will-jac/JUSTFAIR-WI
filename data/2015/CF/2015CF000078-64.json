Case called.  Appearances given.  Defendant Steven J Roller in court, in custody.   Probation Agent Art Coleman appeared for the Dept. of Corrections.  This has been scheduled at the request of Agent Coleman for a court review.  Agent Coleman makes record that it had become evident that Mr. Roller was not living at the address he listed.  There was discussion about trying to get him a stable residence.  The prior agent had the same problem.  Back in first part of February he had a scheduled appointment and said he was in school and not able to make it.  He was to report the following week with his full class schedule and student ID.  He has no information as to his classes.  Defendant was lying and failing to comply with conditions of his supervision.  Mr. Roller would tell his Agent that he was still employed when he was not.  Defendant was eventually picked up on Dane county.  He was still in a holding cell because of suicidal threats when the Agent went to pick him up.  The jail social worker determined that he was not a threat to himself.  DOC is asking for 30 to 60 days in Jail to impress upon him to need to be compliant with his behavior and authority figures.  He was placed in custody on February 15th.  The Dept. does not intend to proceed with a revocation at this time.  3:40 pm  Statement by Mr. Roller that he does not feel that it is necessary for him to be incarceration.  He indicates he has learning disability, anxiety, depression and bipolar.  Agent Coleman states that has not been verified.  Defendant says he has a counselor, Sue,  (Beloit Counseling Center), and a CCS worker through Rock County and a pill provider, Kate, at Beloit Counseling Center.  He says he takes a lot of medications that he takes.  He says he is getting them in the jail and he had not been remembering to take the drugs.  He was living with his ex-girlfriend.  Court admonishes defendant that it is an order of the Court that he must comply with rules and orders of probation which includes telling them where he is living.  He is willing to do that.  Defendant admits that he lied to his Agent about going to school.  He does not have his G.E.D.  He currently gets SSI check so he believes he can only work up to 25 hours per week.  He admits to lying to Agent when he told him that he was still working.  Court admonishes deft that his attitude is incredibly poor.  Defendant says that he is now taking his medications, and he realizes he has to take them.  Agent is hoping defendant can make a few positive choices.  Defendant will speak with his mother to see if she will let him live there.  He was sleeping on a couch at his girlfriend's house, not paying rent and was saying he was helping taking care of her son - and defendant can't take care of himself at the moment.  Defendant's mother lives in Janesville.  The first thing he will do when he gets out is to make sure he has his medication lined up.  Agent is hoping Mr. Roller will get in contact with his Mother so she can assist in getting appointments with his counselor / doctor in order get the medications that he needs.  Court makes record with regard to the nurse practitioner that we have in the jail who might be able to help him with his medications.  Court Orders defendant be held in jail until March 27, 2017.  Immediately upon release from jail he is to report to his Probation Agent in Janesville.
