ADA Monica Hall appears for the State of Wisconsin.\nAttorney Meyer confirms that Mr. Zhang only needs the Court's interpreter to serve in a standby-role. \nYing Patchin is sworn as Standby Chinese-Mandarin Interpreter for Mr. Zhang.\nThe Court and counsel discuss the proposed Juror Questionnaire.  The Court indicates that potential jurors are to arrive at 8:30am on the morning of trial commencement to complete the written questionnaires.  \nThe Court directs that the Jury Clerk is to arrange for a panel of forty jurors to be available in the courtroom for jury selection; there will be 24 jurors in the jury box during the selection process.\n---------------\nAttorney Eisenberg requests that the Court allow a trial deposition of the Defense witness Y.L., due to Y.L's intent to be on a pre-planned trip during the trial dates.  \nAfter hearing arguments from counsel, the Court concludes that such a trial deposition may be presented under (5)(a)(2).  The Court and counsel discuss that a trial deposition will be taken this Thursday afternoon.  After Attorney Eisenberg indicates that the witness needs Chinese-Mandarin interpretation, the Court orders that the costs for the interpreter will be incurred by the Court.  Ms. Patchin confirms that she is available and will provide interpretation for this deposition.\n--------------- \nOn the 5/14/18 Defense Motion to Temporarily Remove Case Information from CCAP:\n--The Court grants the Motion conditional on the clerk being able to remove access from the Jurors, but not from the general public or the media. If the clerk cannot seal the case from the Jurors without allowing other access, then the Court will not seal the case, but instead the Court will take the usual protective measures of instructing the Jury not to view court records or conduct any research, and the Court intends to ask the Jury members each day whether they have viewed or heard anything about the case outside of the courtroom. \n--Chief Deputy Clerk of Courts Hamre Incha is present in the courtroom. She indicates that she has discussed the available functionality with CCAP staff.  The clerk cannot seal the case to the jurors and still have the case available to the public. \n--The Court indicates it will use the protective measures of instructing and questioining the Jury members. \n--------------\nThe Court inquires regarding the Interpretation Needs of the Alleged Victim: \n--ADA Hall indicates that it is her understanding that P.Y. will attend the trial each day.  ADA Hall indicates that she has been unable to verify whether P.Y. will not need full interpretation.  ADA Hall is meeting with P.Y. on Friday afternoon and will make the inquiry then. \n--the Court indicates that arrangements will be made so that there are two interpreters here for the trial, so that the interpreters are prepared to provide simulataneous interpretation. This interpretation will be made available to others who need interpretation in the courtroom. \n-------------- \nOn the Defense 5/14/18 Motion in Limine re Use of the Term \"Victim\":\n--the Court indicates that counsel may refer to P.Y. as \"Ms. Y___\" (last name).  ADA Hall is to make efforts to avoid use of the word victim; however if she uses this wording, it is not cause for a mistrial-motion.  \n--it is clarified that there is no restriction regarding reference to Mr. Zhang as the Defendant.\n--------------\nOther PreTrial Matters: \n--Attorney Eisenberg raises that there is still an issue with the recorded interview  between Officer Servi  and P.Y-- the video is 45 minutes in length, however the video cuts out after 20 minutes. He is aware that ADA Hall is making efforts to obtain new copies of the video. \n--Attorney Eisenberg raises a concern related to the WeChat translation; he is aware that Officer Servi arranged for an interpreter to translate the WeChat conversations however he has no information on who translated it. In response, ADA Hall indicates that she has the same extent of information.  The Court indicates to counsel that they should work together to pursue this information with the UW-Whitewater PD. \n--Counsel discuss that ADA Hall will file an Amended Information to designate Count #1 as being the previously lesser included offense charge of Third Degree Sexual Assault \n--In regard to the State's Notice of Expert Testimony and the cellular telephone records that were extracted,  Defense Counsel acknowledge receipt of the phone downloads.  The Defense is awaiting their expert's report; this will be provided to the State.  \n--Additional arguments are given by counsel on the admission of certain portions of the 8/25/15 Interview.
