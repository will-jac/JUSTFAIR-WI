He believes that Judicial Estoppel applies here.  Atty Wiedenfeld also believes the record is sufficient in that basically the court adopted the recommendation of the PSI.  \n3:32 pm  Court makes record.  Court believes Judicial Estoppel applies here.  Court notes this was a joint recommendation that was made to the Court at the time of sentencing.  It was the defendant's counsel that put the joint recommendation on the record for the Court.  And the only issue was whether the defendant would be eligible for programming at some point during his sentence.  And that issue was decided by the Court in the defendant's favor.  Court cannot find that there is a legal issue here to vacate the sentence and re-sentence.  Court denies Motion for Re-sentence.
