State agrees, advises that 13-CF-89 should be set for sentencing, this case should be set for trial. Defense agrees, advises that Defendant has been found guilty on 13-CF-89. Court advises that Defendant will need to get counsel quicker in that case since sentencing is all that remains, may have to proceed without counsel if he doesn't retain counsel within 4-6 weeks. Defendant is seeking private counsel because he wants to fight everything. Court would expect successor judge to do inquiry into forfeiture of right to counsel if he hasn't retained counsel by sentencing. Atty Singh advises that Defendant wants to fight conviction on 13-CF-89. Court reviews record, finding of guilt in October, case is ripe for sentencing. Atty Singh questions whether PSI would be appropriate. Court doesn't feel it's necessary. State is not requesting one. Defendant wants one. Court orders PSI in 13-CF-89. Court grants motion to withdraw on both cases. Set for trial and pre-trial.","parties":[],"descr":"Status conference","amount":null,"key":"15-2015CF000048-28","ctofc":"Diltz, Peter","date":"2016-03-28","courtRptr":"Jewell, Holly"},{"addlTxt":"by Defendant","parties":[],"descr":"Demand for discovery and inspection","amount":null,"key":"15-2015CF000048-27","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-03-10","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Alex R.
