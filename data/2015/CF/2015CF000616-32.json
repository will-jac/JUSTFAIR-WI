COURT:  This would be his third attorney?  Martinez states he's the second attorney.\nCOURT:  Mr. Cleaves, I saw your letter.  Mr. Martinez was just appointed.  It was set for trial and then a plea.  Mr. Cleaves, what I can tell you is that going through multiple attorneys just because you disagree with what they are telling you, they're telling you that for a reason.  The PD's Ofc will not continue to appoint.  Cleaves states this is his life.   COURT:  Changing attorneys is not going to change that.  You're going to be delayed again.  Possibly for years.  They're asking for 10 years.  I have a life out there.  COURT:  If you don't agree with that, set it for trial.  Today, I'll just set it for trial.  Cleaves states he's still waiting for motions.   There are some discoveries I still haven't gotten.  Martinez is familiar with the motions that Mr. Zachar has filed.  We then set it for a plea.\nCOURT:  Sit down and talk to Mr. Martinez today.  If you still want a different attorney, I'll do that.  I'll tell you that I won't do it again.  Cleaves and Court continues with discussions.  Martinez has no issues with Mr. Cleaves.  Cleaves doesn't have any problem with Mr. Martinez.  This is my live and I just have to fight.  I don't understand why you want me to take a 10 year plea....  You don't have the best interest for me in this case and I'd just like you to resign.  Donskey no obj. to another attorney.  Based on Mr. Cleaves comments today, I dont' think that having another attorney will revolves those.\nCOURT will allow Mr. Martinez to withdraw.  The PD's Of. will re-appoint.
