Attorney Daniel Patrick Steffen appeared for the State.  Case is on for plea/sentencing hearing.    Case is on for Plea/Sentencing Hearing.  Agreement is recited by Attorney Bonneson- def will plead G to 1 count of exposing genitals, State will not request prison, will request PSI, will dismiss other counts, will not charge def with sexual assault charge (uncharged read-in).  DA states that he defers to the court in terms of ordering a PSI.  DA states that State will be free to argue up to 1 year of jail time and will recommend an imposed/stayed prison sentence.  State is free to argue whether or not court orders def to be on the sex offender registry.    \nCourt asks def if they understand the agreement.  Def does.  Court reviews Defs constitutional rights.  Def understands what def is waiving those rights by entering into agreement today.  Court asks Def if they understand Court is not bound by agreement, and could order maximum penalties.  Def understands.  Court asks for plea.  Def enters a plea of Guilty to Count 1: Exposing Genitals/Pubic Area/Intimate Parts to a Child.  Court finds a factual basis to accept the plea.  Court finds def is making plea knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily.  Court finds defendant guilty to said Count 1 and orders a JOC; other counts are DRI.  \nDA argues for: Def to register on sex offender registry for 15 years; after 15 years, may be released off of that registry.  3 years probation, imposed/stayed 18 months IC and 2 yrs ES.  Provides victim impact statement to def and court.  Case is in victim's rights compliance.\nAtty Bonneson argues that State's recommendation regarding probation, IC, and ES is appropriate; argues against registration on the sex offender registry.  Defendant makes statement.  \nCourt orders: 3 years of probation, consecutive to current sentence, with 1.5 years IC and 2 yrs ES im/stayed.  Probation conditions: undergo a sexual risk assessment and follow recommendations; absolute sobriety; regular drug testing; gainful employment.  Must register and be on sex offender registry for the length of time defendant is on probation- successfully discharge, does not need to register anymore.  No use/possession of firearm for life.  No voting in any election until civil rights are restored.  Assesses $518 in costs and fees- prison collects.  Following release from custody, payments of $50/mo.  If probation is revoked or discharged with outstanding financial obligations, a civil judgment shall be entered against the defendant in favor of restitution victims and/or governmental entities for the balance due.  All available enforcement actions will be used to collect the debt.  3 days jail credit.  Def must contact probation.
