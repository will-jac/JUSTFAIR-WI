Atty Bernardo Cueto.  Edward Minser appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\nCueto spoke to Mr. Ottman a few days ago to waive time limits.  I haven't talked to him since.  I left a message with him yesterday about today hrg.  He's only 17.  Asks for a few days to track him down.  Minser serious charges.  Asks for a warrant.  Cueto: He's on a GPS monitoring so he should be easy to track down.\nBENCH WARRANT.  $1,000 cash bond.\n11:09 am   Def. now present in court.  State by Ed Minser\nCourt will quash the warrant.\nMr. Ottman waives the PH time limits.\nCOURT finds he F, V & I waives the time limits.  Finds good cause to go behond the time limits.\nMinser:  The victim lives next door and I have concerns about safety...  Doesn't feel that's an appropriate residence for him.  Cueto:  He has no place else to go.  He has family in the State of Indiana.  He's still in high schoo.  Obj. to any change in the home.\nCourt:  Are these 2 separte residences?  Minser:  They are 2 separte homes.  No violations.\nCOURT will not change the bond.  There's no place for him to go.  It might make sense for family to find another address.  He's on GPS and he can be watched as to where he goes.\nPH:  8/14 at 11 am    TWB","parties":[],"descr":"Preliminary hearing","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000444-7","ctofc":"Levine, Elliott M","date":"2015-07-24","courtRptr":"Stello, Michelle"},{"addlTxt":"Bernardo Cueto","parties":[],"descr":"Public defender order appointing counsel","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000444-6","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-07-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"for RAG\nDef w/atty Huh\nBond to cont\nPH: 7/24 @ 11 (EML)","parties":[],"descr":"Initial appearance","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000444-4","ctofc":"Bjerke, Todd W","date":"2015-07-17","courtRptr":"Frydenlund, Amy"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Responsible court official changed","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000444-3","ctofc":"Lacrosse County, Unassigned","date":"2015-07-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"File Retained Electronically","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000444-2","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-07-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Complaint filed","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000444-1","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-07-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Def in custody w/atty Terrien\n  Pretrial report filed\n$2500 sig bond signed w/cond: no contact w/KJJ, comply w/JS w/GPS House arrest\nINIT: 7/17 @ 1:30 (RAG)","parties":[],"descr":"Bail/bond hearing","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000444-5","ctofc":"Gonzalez, Ramona A.","date":"2015-07-10","courtRptr":"Frydenlund, Amy"}],"prosAgency":"District Attorney","citations":[],"defAttys":[{"name":"Cueto, Bernardo"}],"balanceDue":704.00,"allowPurchase":false},"view":{"caseNo":{"value":"2015CF000444"},"countyNo":{"value":32}}}
