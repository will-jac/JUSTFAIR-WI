Argument by ADA - State was not aware that there was a valid RX for the substance - admits confusion over the substance that factored into the amendment.  Further argument by Atty Lennon.  Police Officer reports provided for Court's review as to the substance in question.  Highlighting for the Court the substance on the toxicology report.  Def confirms for the Court that she is not contesting the plea as entered - admits contraband introduced into the Jail setting and is not requesting to withdraw the plea.

No statement offered.   Court reminds Def of the gravity of the conduct involved.
