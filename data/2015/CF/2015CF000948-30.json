ADA Zapf is not available 3/10. DA's office is also not able to effectuate subpoenas for witnesses to appear by next week. Court finds that due to circumstances beyond the control of the court, speedy trial demands cannot be met. Court therefore denies DE's motion for immediate JT for cause. Atty Edwards moves to modify bond to signature. ST requests tolling of time limits to allow continuance of cash bonds. Court grants DE's motion and modifies bond to $25K signature. All conditions are to continue. Motion hearing on suppression set. Atty Edwards renews request for discovery that she believes to still be unsatisfied from the US Marshals. ST states some of the requested materials have already been turned over. Court finds that the specific requests made for discovery for items held by the US Marshals are beyond the scope of the statute / capabilities of the ST. Therefore, the court makes no order to the ST as to DE's motion for discovery.  Motion hearing scheduled for April 28, 2016 at 09:30 am.

Atty Edwards will be filing a Motion to Suppress 2/12/16 and requests the Motion be heard on 2/29 - denied. Suppression motion will be heard, however it will recalibrate the Speedy Trial Demand timeline.  Atty Edwards objects to any change in the Speedy Trial Demand due to the discovery issue named in 15CF947 - modification of DE's bond also requested. DDA Graveley states that multiple contacts have been made with PPPD, and no further discovery is available - of which Atty Edwards has been made aware. PPPD had no records of any requests from DE counsel prior to 1/28. The ST, however, made the release timely. Further discussion held. Discussion held on Atty Edwards' bond motion - requests bond be reduced to $2-5K. ADA Zapf opposes any modification of bond. For reasons set forth on the record, Court finds that the bond as set is appropriate - motion to modify bond is denied. Court further finds that NO suppression motion based on the issue of discovery as set forth on the record today will be entertained.
