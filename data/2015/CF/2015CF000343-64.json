He believes Deft may have had an SPD appointed Attorney at some point.  Atty Wiedenfeld believes an Attorney was appointed in 2017 by the Court.  Court sees that on October 11, 2017 Judge Drettwan denied without hearing, the defendant's Motions and then 9 days later she appointed Attorney Renz.  Deft says the Judge Drettwan approved the appointment of counsel.  Court notes that Atty Renz drafted a Motion and a letter was sent in October 2019.  Atty Renz filed a Motion to Reinstate his Post-conviction Motion which was denied.  Court notes that was just 809.30 Motions.  Atty Wiedenfeld doesn't believe it would preclude all motions.  Court requires he contact SPD office because Court can't appoint until the SPD office determines they cannot appoint an attorney for him.  Court directs defendant to contact the SPD office in Walworth County.  Atty Wiedenfeld believes he should probably be reaching out to the appellate division.  Phone number for appellate office in Madison - 608-266-3440 - PO Box 7862, Madison, WI  53707-7862.  \nCourt will put this off for approximately 1 month.  Court not addressing motion and not denying motion.  Court set new court date set for May 28 at 3:30 pm.
