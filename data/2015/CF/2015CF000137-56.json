Smith.  Attorney Dennis Joseph Ryan appeared by video & audio by ZOOM means for Plaintiff State of Wisconsin. Defendant Lavekeio L. Smith appeared by phone means from New Lisbon Correctional by ZOOM.  Seeking sentence modification.  Two factor inquiry.  Atty. Lohr makes argument with COVID 19 in jail/prison is a major new factor.  Objective test - wasn't present at sentencing. 2nd if warranted for modification.  State agrees new factor with COVID 19.  Health concerns is a highly relevant in sentencing decision,  for the first step of the analysis.  Atty. Lohr makes argument for 2nd step of modification.  Health issues.  Social distancing, cleanliness and masking.  Not following guidelines.  2 proposals - Ct 1 & 2 confinement portion done, serving Count 4 now. Modify Count 4 to  2 yrs. 10 mos. I.C. concurrent & 5 yrs. E.S. OR under 973.015(8) stay sentence for legal cause until safe to come back.  DE does have housing if released.  Atty. Ryan gives argument and objects to modification DE not entitled to relief as proposed today.  Court states can't take judicial notice, agents haven't been face to face with probationers. Atty. Lohr responds.  Court believes sentence that was imposed is appropriate and denies motion for modification.
