Victim Rights in compliance.  Argument by DA.  Argument by SPD.  Statement by Defendant:  Yes.  The Court:  3 prong analysis explained.  Probation would unduly depreciate the severity of what happened in this instance.  Orders 6 yr  term of imprisonment, bifurcated as 3 yrs IC/3 yrs ES consecutive to any existing sentence currently being served - each of these 3 sentences are consecutive to that sentence - Waushara Counts concurrent to one another however.  Conditions of ES:  AODA and any follow thru as recommended; the defendant must maintain absolute sobriety, may not be present upon the premises of any bars, and is prohibited from possessing/ingesting any impairing substances that have not been prescribed by a physician; Any other counseling or treatment agent deems appropriate; Court Costs plus DNA surcharge; $1150.00 Buy Money from 8/6/2015 transaction; No contact with A. Beerbohm; Eligible for CIP and Eligible for SAP; 33 days TS credit against sentence.  Defendant wishes to contest Drug Buy Money.  Court would expect that Buy Money was previously photocopied prior to use.  SPD not aware as per discovery received.  The record does establish sufficiently that there was purchase money and orders $1150 be reimbursed for that expenditure.  Appeal Rights Given.  No DNA specimen ordered - provided in a previous conviction.  Surcharge ordered as to each count and repaid up to 25% of earnings while incarcerated.","parties":[],"descr":"Sentencing hearing","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CF000122-27","ctofc":"Dutcher, Guy D","date":"2016-01-15","courtRptr":"Sisco, Cheryl"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Pre-sentence investigation filed","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CF000122-26","ctofc":"Dutcher, Guy D","date":"2016-01-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Petition and Order for Writ of Habeas Corpus ad Prosequendum","parties":[],"descr":"Petition for writ of habeas corpus","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CF000122-25","ctofc":"Dutcher, Guy D","date":"2015-11-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Count Nos. 4 through 7","parties":[],"descr":"Judgment of dismissal/acquittal","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CF000122-24","ctofc":"Zamzow, Melissa","date":"2015-11-02","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Order for pre-sentence investigation","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CF000122-23","ctofc":"Dutcher, Guy D","date":"2015-11-02","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Plea questionnaire, waiver of rights","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CF000122-22","ctofc":"Dutcher, Guy D","date":"2015-10-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Sentencing hearing at 01-15-2016 02:15 pm","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CF000122-21","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Case Called @ 2:45 PM: Defendant Jermaine Dwayne Douglas in court with attorney Ben Szilagyi.
