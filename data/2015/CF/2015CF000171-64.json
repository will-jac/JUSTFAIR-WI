Appearances given. \nDefendant Jamie L Oestreicher appeared;  \nADA Matthew R. Leusink appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  \nClerk attempted to call probation agent Brad Hafner but there was no answer and no option to leave a voice mail.  \nCourt provides defendant with a copy of the letter sent by victim.  Court addresses defendant and asks what her plan is for paying restitution.  She says she has been paying $50.00 per week since she's been employed.  It comes out of her paycheck.  She does not intend to stop making those payments even if she is not on probation.  9:40 am  Response by Atty Leusink.  He is happy to hear she is making payments but She believes she has been making a good faith effort.  Atty Leusink is asking that probation be extended.  Victims were notified by the State as to today's hearing.  Ms. Oestreicher objects to her probation being extended.  She has been working regularly for the last 2 & 1/2 years.  She feels very strongly about paying back what is owed.  She has been making the $50 payments for at least 2 years or 2.5 years.  Court would consider this if she went to her employer and worked out a wage assignment that would go directly to the victim.  Court will extend probation for 2 years but if in the mean time, she can work out a wage assignment that is acceptable to Accent on You, the Court would terminate probation.  Response by deft to Court's question as to what happened to the money she got?  Court extends probation for 2 years.
