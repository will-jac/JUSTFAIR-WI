In Court's opinion he was advised of his rights and was asked if he understood them.  he answered in the affirmative and continued to speak with them and answer their questions.  For reasons State forth.  Court finds that the State has met its burden of proof.  Court denies defense's motion to suppress the statements pursuant to Miranda.  There has been no challenge to the voluntariness of his statements.  Court does not find tha there would be any challenge under a Goodchild type of motion. \n\nCourt next deals with Defense's request to expand some of the portions of the defendant's statement that the State had intended to use.  Court has the letter submitted by Atty Stilling.  \n#1 - Court will allow page 12, line 19 through page 19, line 15; \n#2 - Atty Stilling had asked that page 32, line 15, through page 33, line 9, be added;  State has no objection.  State can introduce starting at page 32, line 15 through to page 41, line 5; Defense is asking for portions to be redacted.  Court agrees with the defense concerns - State can introduce page 32, line 15 through page 40, line 13; \n#3 - Page 46 - instead of starting at line 18, to start at line 9 and both parties agree to go through page 56, line 21; \n\"Tracking periods\" - Page 116 of transcript; State wants to introduce line 20 through page 121, line 4 - Defense has no objection; Next, backing up page 111 line 5 through page 113, line 10; State has no objection to stopping at page 113 through line 3; \"Camp discussion\":  No objection by defense to portions that State wishes to use in their case in chief;  \n\nCourt next addresses the objection by the State to proposed testimony of Dr. Thompson.  \nCourt has reviewed all the written materials submitted by the parties.  \n4:16 pm  Argument by Attorneys.  \n4:27 pm  Court makes record and references Sec. 907.02.  Case law makes it clear that the Court is to act as a gatekeeper.  Court makings findings.  1) Defense wants Dr. Thompson to testify with regard to memory.  He cannot and would not testify as to whether her memory has been affected.  Court does think that testimony with regard to memory as proposed by the defense is relevant.  Court finds that this proffered testimony is material and reliable.  2)  Court will not allow testimony with regard to common behaviors and characteristics in the adolescent's age group.  Court will also not allow testimony with regard to the adolescent brain development;  3)  Next issue would be testimony with regard to fetal alcohol syndrome.  Atty Stilling asks that the Court not rule on this today.  Atty Stilling believes there will be more information that will come in through other testimony.  Court will allow this to be revisited outside presence of jury before he would testify.  Court makes record under 904.03 - Court does think it has probative value and court does not think that the probative  value would be substantially outweighed by prejudice to the State.  Court does not want there to be any questions or topic areas that would induce an answer that is in violation of Hazeltine.    Next Motion is the defendan't motion with regard to other acts.  Court makes record as to evidence that the defense wishes to be able to introduce.  Court does not believe this is a 904.04(2) analysis - this is not other acts so Court will not do a Sullivan analysis.  Court makes findings with regard to the divorce of the parents.  Court will allow testimony to come in that it was an ugly divorce; that one or both parents put the children in middle and that for a period of time pursuant to court order the father could not have contact with the children - or that it had to be supervised contact with the children.  There is to be no evidence as to why they got divorced.  Court next addresses page 2 of the defendant's motion to exclude - February 23rd 1) Allowing that to come in under the context decision with the exception of the final 8 words.  2) Not admissible; 3) Not admissible; 4) Not admissible; not relevant; 5) The first half (court reads into record) is allowed; but Court does not believe her responses are allowed; Court hears argument of Attorneys; 6)  Court questions relevance as to #6; response by Atty Stilling.  Response by Atty Johnson; Court will not make a ruling at this time; 7)  Atty Johnson does not object;  \n\n5:10 pm  Atty Stilling makes record with regard to an out-of-state witness (Madison) they have been attempting to get served with a subpoena for trial.  Atty Stilling will know more tomorrow.  Continued discussion between Court and Attorneys with regard to witness.  Court sets further status conference Friday afternoon, March 10th at 2:30 pm.  Atty Still and the defendant can appear by phone.  \n\n5:20 pm  Court in recess.","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000271-92","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2017-03-08","courtRptr":"Matoska, Linda"},{"addlTxt":"E-mail to Attys forwarding Affidavit of Det.

Attorney Stilling does not have the records yet that she has requested.  Court notes that the diagnosis that we are aware of now was made when the victim was an infant.  Court finds that based upon St vs Smith there is a sufficient basis for Ms. Hocking's testimony.  As far as relevancy is concerned, the Court does not believe there has been a sufficent showing by the Defense to rise to level of concerns that this child has such extreme disabilities to make the testimony irrelevant.  Court denies the Motion at this time but will leave the door open to revisit this if there is additional information provided to the Court.  \n\nArgument by Attorney Stilling with regard to the State's Expert's Summary of Ms. Hocking's testimony.  She asks the Court to Order the State to provide a summary of expert's testimony that is relevant to this particular case.  Attorney Johnson indicates it is a summary, and it is not intended to limit the witness' testimony to the summary.  A copy of the State's Summary has been marked as Exhibit #1 and the Ms. Hocking's CV is Exhibit #2.  Response by Attorney Stilling.  The Court notes that if there is some testimony solicited with respect to recantation, the defense would always have the ability to object to relevancy at that time.  The Court does not wish to make any rulings at this time.  \n\nState estimates having 7 witnesses.  Attorney Stilling estimates 5 witnesses or maybe more.  Attorney Still believes 5 days will be required for trial.  \n\nFinal pre-trial scheduled for June 8, 2016 at 02:30 pm.  \nJury trial - 12 person scheduled for June 13, 2016 at 08:30 am.  \n\n3:30 p.m.  Court in recess.","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000271-32","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2016-01-21","courtRptr":"Grzenia, Eileen"},{"addlTxt":"Motion Hearing before the Honorable David M.
