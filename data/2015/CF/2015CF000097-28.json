Hunt.  ADA Monica Hall and DA Susan Happ appear for the State of Wisconsin [DA Happ later exited the hearing at 4:16pm.]\nAttorney Hunt acknowledges that his legal issue-research has shown that the burden of proof on Daubert is on the proponent. Attorney Hunt indicates that the Defense has no additional information to submit on the Defense Expert Witness James Oehldrich. \nThe Court will not allow the final conclusion in the Report of the Defense Expert Witness that, \"... but for the Oxycodone, that Mr. Sterwald took after his last dose of Heroin, Mr. Sterwald would not have died.\"\nThe Court orders that this last line of the Report will be excluded as not being in the area of expertise of the Defense expert. The other two subject opinions are allowed as being in the area of expertise for that witness. \n\nAfter hearing arguments on the opinions in the expert report in Motion paragraphs 3 and 4, the Court concludes that the Defense has not met the burden to allow the opinion (paragraph 3) on the amount of morphine in the urine as it relates to heroin use on multiple occasions, and the opinion (paragraph 4) on the lack of 6-Monoacetylmorphine in the blood; these two opinions will not be allowed because the Defense has not shown that these opinions are based on reliable principals and methods. \n\nAfter hearing arguments on the opinion in the expert report in Motion paragraph 5 regarding the lack of oxycodone in the urine, the Court concludes that the opinion will not be allowed for the reason that it is not based on accurate information; the undisputed fact is that the victim's urine was not tested for oxycodone, so the opinion is based on insufficient or incorrect facts.  The last two sentences in paragraph 5 and the first sentence in paragraph are excluded. \n\nAt the request of Attorney Hunt the Court clarifies that the Court will allow the expert give the opinion that if Mr. Sterwald had used Oxycodone three hours before his death, there would have been oxycodone in his urine. The Court notes that the State has not asked for exclusion of this sentence. \n\nAttorney Hunt requests the opportunity to give a brief offer-of-proof at trial, when the expert witness is present, as to the paragraph 3,4, and 5 rulings.  \nThe Court will allow for this opportunity if this Defense believes they can demonstrate that there are reliable principals and methods underlying the 3 & 4 opinions. The Court alerts Attorney Hunt that there may be a notice-issue related to this from the State.  \n-----------------------------------------------------\nThe Court hears arguments on the Defendant's 9/30/16 Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Purported Expert Detective Sergeant Gray\nDet. Sgt. Margareta Gray- sworn & testifies\n--direct examination by ADA Hall\nThe Court determines that Detective Sergeant Gray may give the opinion testimony as set forth in the State's Notice.  The Court finds that Detective Sergeant Gray's testimony given today does support the conclusion that her opinions are based on reliable principals and methods.  \nThe Court denies the Defense Motion to Exclude the testimony of Detective Sergeant Gray. \n------------------------------------------------------\nThe Court hears arguments on the Defendant's 10/3/16 Amended Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Dr. Brian Peterson as Impermissible Surrogate Testimony. \nADA Hall clarifies that Dr. Peterson is going to give his own opinions related to his review of the case; Dr. Peterson is aware that he is not allowed, in any way, to relay the opinions of Dr. Rogalska. \nBased on the Griep case law, the Court allows the testimony of Dr. Peterson on his independant opinions; Dr. Peterson is allowed to rely upon the reports of Dr. Roglaska and of the toxicologist.    \n------------------------------------------------------\nThe Court hears arguments on the State's Motion for Reconsideration; the Defendant's Motion Exhibit #1 and State's Motion Exhibit #2 copies of text messages are received.   The Court maintains its prior ruling that the text messages from Mr. Beverly and Ms. Cahoon are admissible.  \n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Court addresses procedural matters related to the Jury Trial: \n--the Court intends to carry two additional jurors; each party will have five strikes during peremptory challenges\n--the jurors should be ready to begin the jury selection process at 9:00am on the first morning of trial\n--the Court will allow the Jurors to take notes and to ask written questions of witnesses  \n--counsel agree that the trial length will be five days; ADA Hall indicates that the State anticipates completing its case in chief by end of day on Wednesday; Attorney Hunt believes the Defense case can be completed within two days  \n--in response to the Court's inquiry, Attorney Hunt indicates that there is no need for a Miranda-Goodchild hearing \n--the Court extends the time for any case negotiations to Friday November 18th at noon; Attorney Hunt is to notify the Court of any intended change-of-plea by that afternoon so that a writ can be issued for a plea hearing to occur on November 22nd or November 23rd.\nReconvene 5:05pm \n[Post Hearing/Off-Record: the Court reminds Attorney Hunt that the Defense will need to make arrangements for Ms. Scheiber to have street clothes to wear during the Jury Trial.] \n\nNEXT:  Jury Trial remains on the Court's calendar to commence on 11/28/16 for a five day length \n","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000097-184","ctofc":"Koschnick, Randy","date":"2016-11-10","courtRptr":"Hanson, Katie R."},{"addlTxt":"Defense","parties":[],"descr":"Jury instructions","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000097-183","ctofc":"Koschnick, Randy","date":"2016-11-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"STATE'S ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NOTICE OF INTENT TO ADMIT STATEMENTS MADE BY THE DEFENDANT\n","parties":[],"descr":"Notice","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000097-182","ctofc":"Koschnick, Randy","date":"2016-11-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Letter from the State regarding statements of the defendant.","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000097-181","ctofc":"Koschnick, Randy","date":"2016-11-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Letter from the State regarding statements of the defendant.","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000097-180","ctofc":"Koschnick, Randy","date":"2016-11-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"from the State regarding daubert burden","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000097-179","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-11-03","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Case called at 3:22pm [ma]\nDefendant Christy L Scheiber in court, in custody with Attorney Edward J.
