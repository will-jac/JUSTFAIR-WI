He's had 2. He wasn't even aware of the first violation. He wasn't intending to dilute. The missed UA, he had met w/ me and forgot he had to contact them. Positive UA - to be frank, he and I talked about his current situation and he was distressed by that and resorted to his old ways. He assures me that it's not an issue. I explained that the court  can put him back in jail but he's putting in jeopardy a large cash bond that was posted by friends and family. He's asking for another chance. He had 7 mos of fairly good behavior. He's willing to test daily. KELLIS: for the majority of this case he has been bond requirement. He had a relapse. I wish he would have admitted that at the time. But leave to the court. CRT: I want to be clear - I won't stand by and watch bond violations. Serious offenses. Potential for a length period of incarceration. When I get a JSS report I have 3 options....  Another report showing missed or diluted unless they are minors or strong mitigating factors, I woudn't have a problem issuing an OTD.

Atty Skemp filed a mtn to extend as discovery hasn't been completed and I wanted a hearing. SKEMP: I filed the mtn as we were going thru the discover we have. We have been given over 100 photos but we can't really see them due to the quality. As to my client, those are charges back to  2012 and the CI's were wired and we don't have the audio from those buys yet. There are almost 30k pgs of info on FB and  500+ calls from jail. Just going thru those is a huge amt of time. I talked to DDA Barton and Atty Betthauser and I think the trial date set is overly optomistic. BETTHAUSER: I filed a speedy trial and w/drew that. I have 28gigs on a flash drive. It's a lot to get thru even in the mos we had this case. I would feel more comfortable if all parties had more time to prepare an adequate defense to our clients. HYNEK; we don't object to the con't of the trial. We are aware of the amt of volume of info but ask that they remain together.  CRT: I think I should set a hearing where all 3 are present.
