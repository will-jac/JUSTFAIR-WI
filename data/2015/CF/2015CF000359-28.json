ADA Theresa Beck appears for the State of Wisconsin.\nDefense Co-Counsel, Attorney Jeffrey De La Rosa, is present during portions of the hearing. \n\nOn the dual Motions regarding third party-person evidence of a person who could have committed the offense, under Denny case law:\n--Arguments given by Attorney Svehlek, Attorney De La Rosa, and ADA Beck. \n--The Court grants the Defense Motion.  The Defense will be allowed to argue and submit evidence in support of their theory that D.O. committed the crime.     \n\nOn the issue of allowing victim D.O. to be present in the courtroom during the evidentiary portion of the trial: \n--the parties agree that D.O. fits the definition under 950.02(4b) of being a person who resided in the home of the victim\n--the Court orders Witness Exclusion\n--after hearing arguments from Attorney Svehlek and ADA Beck, the Court concludes that it is not authorized to exclude witnesses or anyone else from the trial other than during the evidentiary portion of trial;  the Court orders that witnesses or potential witnesses are not to be present in the courtroom except when testifying and that this Order takes effect after Opening Statements are completed, and this Order expires once Evidence is closed. \n--the Court orders that witnesses and potential witnesses shall not communicate with each other commencing at 8:30 on the morning of Day 1 of Trial and ending when the Evidence is closed.  To the extent that the Courts allow victim-witnesses in the courtroom, the Order regarding not communicating with each other remains in effect.  \n--the Court finds that D.O. does have the State Constitutional right to be present at the trial; the Court does not find that sequestration is necessary--the presence of D.O. will not compromise the Defendant's right to a fair trial.  \n\nOn the State's Motion to Admit Other Acts:  \n--ADA Beck confirms that the State does intend to admit the Defendant's statements regarding accidents involving the child\n--arguments given by ADA Beck, by Attorney Svehlek related to the prior bad act of the Texas conviction\n--recess 10:34am, reconvene 10:51am.\n--the Court grants the Motion contigent upon the Defense arguing or presenting testimony that the Defendant caused the child's death by accident. If the Defense puts in evidence that is suggestive of that theory, then the prior bad act of the Defendant abusing his girlfriend in Texas in 2012 comes in.  The Court will give a cautionary instruction if requested by either party.\n--the Court clarifies that the Defendant will be allowed to introduce evidence that he is a seen as good parent so long as those descriptions do not include non-violence.  If the Defense introduces argument or evidence that the Defendant is a non-violent person or of non-violent character, then the State will be allowed to present this evidence.\n\nOn the State's 9/2/16 Motion to Exclude Testimony of Defense Expert Witness Gary Rini and Expert Report at Trial: \n--arguments given by Attorney Svehlek, by ADA Beck\n--the Court finds that there has been a violation of the discovery order; there is prejudice to the State by this delay. The Court does not find that good cause has been shown for this violation. The Court grants the Motion to Exclude. \n--however Attorney Svehlek then argues for the Court to give consideration to Statute 971.23 (7m)(b), asserting that the Court has the discretion not to exclude the expert because of a discovery violation.\ntherefore State to continue to respond to the Defense expert in good faith.  \n--the Court schedules a continued hearing on this issue, requiring counsel to file, by end of business on Monday [9/26/16] a letter informing the Court whether they have found any related case law, and giving any citations to legal authority.   \nrecess 11:38am. \n\nNEXT:  Motion Hearing on 9/27/16 at 11:15am \n","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000359-77","ctofc":"Koschnick, Randy","date":"2016-09-21","courtRptr":"Hanson, Katie R."},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's Sur-Reply to Motion for Defense to Disclose Third Party / Person Evidence","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000359-76","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Attorney Jeffrey De La Rosa (co-chair with Attorney Dahnert)","parties":[],"descr":"Public defender order appointing counsel","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000359-75","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-09-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"STATES NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION TO EXCLUDE TESTIMONY OF EXPERT WITNESS GARY RINI AND EXPERT REPORT AT TRIAL\n","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of motion, motion","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000359-74","ctofc":"Koschnick, Randy","date":"2016-09-02","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"State's Reply to Defendant's Reposnse to Motion to Disclose 3rd Party/Person Evidence","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000359-73","ctofc":"Koschnick, Randy","date":"2016-09-01","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant's Reponse to State's Motion for Defense to Disclose Third Party/Person Evidence","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000359-72","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-26","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Enclosed with Defendant's Response to State's Motion for Defense to Disclose Third/Party Person Evidence","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000359-71","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-26","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion hearing on September 21, 2016 at 08:30 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000359-70","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-26","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"State's Exhibit #2 from 8/24/16 Motion Hearing (Interview Video)","parties":[],"descr":"Exhibit","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000359-185","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-24","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"State's Exhibit #1 from 8/24/16 Motion Hearing (Medical Records - Ordered Selaed by the Court)","parties":[],"descr":"Exhibit","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000359-183","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-24","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Scheduling data sheet","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000359-69","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-24","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Case called at 8:40am [MA]\nDefendant Terrance L Curtis in court, in custody with Attorney Elizabeth F Svehlek.
