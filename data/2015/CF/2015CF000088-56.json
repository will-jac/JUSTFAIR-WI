Agrees to file motion to seek to admit should one come up.  Court grants the State's motions and requests the State to prepare an order to reflect that and the statements being admitted.  State addresses motion filed the same days re: prior criminal convictions which they feel would be 10.  Atty Ruby argues against counting the OAR convictions and two others.  State responds.  Court will allow use of all 10 convictions should the DE testify.  Court notes motion re: discovery sanctions has been addressed.  State withdraws that motion at this time as they have received discovery as requested.  Court will not address concerns re: lateness of discovery as the State is now withdrawing their motion.  State has reviewed request by DE and they are ready to address those matters.  Atty Calkins addresses first motion re: sequestration to be obeyed only during testimony, otherwise no objection.  Atty Ruby responds, wants sequestration during opening statements too.  Parties respond.  Atty Ruby withdraws objection.  Court grants sequestration during trial/testimony only.  Will not apply during voir dire or opening statements.  State doesn't object to motions 2-5.  State requests Court hold #6 at bay at this time.  Atty Ruby agrees.  Parties agree the same on #7.  Court will hold open 6 and 7.  #8 has already been held.  #9 would be addressed outside of the jury if a person is to testify.  #10 addresses prelim hearing testimony and that would be a heresay evidence rule.  #11 - State marks exhibit #2 in response.  Atty Ruby interrupts and states he isn't objecting to the statement the State is trying to argue.  Court holds open making decision at this point.  State doesn't object to #12.  #13 is a general request and may need to be addressed.  Atty Ruby notes his motion may be too broad.  Court holds open ruling pending it coming up at trial.  State responds to #14.  Court notes no objection to 14.  State responds to #15 - stipulation to be submitted as to the 911 call.  Atty Ruby is in agreement.  Final stipulations could be filed by the end of next week.  Court notes DE motion to admit evidence of character & habit.  State notes none of the evidence in the appendix should be submitted.  Atty Ruby cites probitive information re: speeding possibly being a factor.  State responds.  Atty Ruby requests clarification.  State requests from the Court how she would like him to proceed.  Atty Ruby responds.  State makes statement made in Dep. Wex's report re: seatbelt.  Atty Ruby responds.  Court questions State re: \"character\" of the victim concern.  State responds.  Court questions Atty Ruby re: \"character\" evidence.  Atty Ruby responds.  Court notes her intention is to allow parties to submit further written argument.  They will have one week to submit that or until 8/30/2016.  Court would then set this for continued hearing shortly after that week is up.  State notes he will be availabe on 9/2 as is Atty Ruby but he'd prefer to make oral arguments today re: the motions filed rather than do them in writing.  State continues argument.  Atty Ruby states anything else he wishes to add he can do in writing.  Court advises State again to prepare an order for the Court's signature on their motions granted today.  Advises Atty Ruby to do the same.  Written responses due from both parties by 8/30/2016.  Court sets bench ruling for 9/2/2016.  Oral ruling scheduled for September 2, 2016 at 02:00 pm.","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"56-2015CF000088-60","ctofc":"Klicko, Wendy J.
