Svehlek - believes there may have been an error in regards to a date but will inform the Court if she finds that. State - informs Court that the State and the Court received a letter that was filed by Svehlek for the defendant - makes argument for sentencing prior to his recommendation - 310 days credit - recommends 18 months in WI State Prison System with no ES (roughly 8 months left to serve). Court asks about bifurcation of the sentence as it is a prison recommendation. State recommends 2 years in the WI State Prison System consisting of 18 months of initial incarceration followed by 6 months of ES. Svehlek informs Court of incorrect date. Svehlek makes sentencing argument prior to sentencing - recommends 1 year in the county jail with credit for 310 days, if the Court orders a prison sentence - asks that he be found eligible for Substance Abuse Program. Kroening withholds comment. Court puts on the record that it has reviewed the letter filed by the defendant in regards to today's hearing - questions if the defendant is eligible for SPD - asks questions about why the defendant has not paid anything on the fines. Kroening responds. Court asks for clarification of the 310 days that the State came up with for credit. State responds. Court came up with less time, reviews it, does come up with the same amount as the State of 310 days credit.
