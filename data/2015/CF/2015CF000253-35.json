Kurt Byron Zengler appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Case called appearances given.  Court takes up the issue of competency.  The second doctor has found that the deft is competent to stand trial.  The defense did not make arrangement for the doctor to appear at this hearing  Defense tries to call the doctor by phone Not able to get ahold of Dr Seefeldt by phone.  Defense informs the court that the defense would like also try to call Dr Stress. The court questions if the deft feels she is competent to continue.  The defense attorney talks with the deft and she stand mute.   Court has decussion with parties on how to proceed.  Checks the statues.  Court informs the parties that by the deft standing mute she is to be found incompetent and we will need to schedule a evidency hearing and the burden is now on the State. Because of this issue the current jury questionaire are not of use and a new trial date will need to be set and new questionaires completed.  The state does have a recording of a statement/deposition from the victim if he was to become unavailable due to health, competency or death before the trial date  Defense did have a chance to cross of the victim during the deposition and was found to be competent.  Due to the issues of competency we will not be able to address any of the other motions.  State questions this statement by the court.  Arguements heard as to how to proceed on the State's motion.  Court is not able to  find anything  in the Statue book on how to proceed on the State's motion.  State addresses the court. Before anymore hearings are scheduled we need to hear the Motion filed with State to Strike the pleadings of the Defense.  This is how the Court feels we need to proceed: Deft is standing Mute at this time.  Because of this all proceedings  are at a stand still.  Court will schedule the Motion of the State at the time of Competency hearing.  Then if the court finds the deft competent all the other motions will need a hearing.  \n\nBecause of the present issues the county has incurred a great cost do to the fact of having the jury questionaires being completed  Defense informs the court they are willing to talk with the state to reach an agreement.  But the State is not able to do that at this time becease the State does not know the strength of the defense's case.\n\nCourt finds that there is good cause for the doctors to appear by phone or video.
