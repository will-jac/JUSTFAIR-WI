Argument by Atty Kuchler.  \n5:12 pm  Argument by Atty Johnson.  \n5:16 pm  Court makes record.  Court notes that the defense is not challenging that these crimes occurred to this family.

Court denies defense instruction #2; Atty Kuchler makes record with regard to proposed Defense Instruction #3; Argument by Atty Johnson; Court notes we have instructions 245, 246 and there is not a standard instruction with regard to confidential informants.  Court's concern is how defense instruction #3 is worded.  Court believes that for the most part it is covered by 300 but if defense wants to craft an alternative instruction with regard to the C.I. which is like 245, then the Court would read that instruction.  Court next deals with defense proposed instruction 6.  Discussion between Attorneys and Court.  Court doesn't see a necessity for the Instruction and the defense can make an argument on it to the jury.  Court addresses Instruction 246 with the Attys.  Court believes it is appropriate with regard to Michael Kraft.  Atty Johnson wishes to add to Instruction 1480 and add Mrgim Fejza.  Atty Kuchler has no objection.  Atty Kuchler argues that there should be an Instruction 246 given for both Michael Kraft and for CI1118.  Atty Johnson would like to review the comments on the instruction.  Court is going to agree with the defense after reviewing the comments to the Instruction.  Court will agree with the Defense and asks State to prepare Instruction 246 in line with the Court's direction.  6:12 pm  Court in recess.  \n","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000046-97","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2017-05-24","courtRptr":"Matoska, Linda"},{"addlTxt":"Albanian Interpreters:  Edlira Sula and Shqiprim Xheladini;  \nBAILIFFS:  Bob Nitka, Diane Mullins and Nancy Lyon;  \n8:46 am  Court in session.
