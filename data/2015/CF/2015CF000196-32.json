Last Sat I relapsed and used and that' the biggest one for me. I had just been avoiding going into a hosp cuz I was sick but I was trying to avoid a Dx that I was going to get. I let my bracelet die. There are things I shouldn't have lied about. I am still getting used to and trying to understand you are trying to help me. I keep pushing the help away. I hope this time when I get out I am excited to start over and really put in an effort. Last time I didn't think it would take much to beat the addiction but I was wrong. \nCrt: if you sneak out of the facility, get drugs and lie you will be expelled and unless the violations are extremely minor, and to date, they have not, you are building a strong case for sig time in prison. What has shocked me has been your attitude, the deceit to those who are trying to help you. You will be released at 6 AM Sat 6/27 and will be on lock down on Ophelia's house until 6 AM on Monday 6/29. While on lock down want you to take a look at the partial trans of your sentencing and I want you to read that and the explanations you gave and the commitments you made at the time of sentence and prepare a written document on your comments at sentencing and we will discuss that next week at DC. The goal is for you to get back in touch w/ your state of mind at sentencing and I wonder if you were sincere then or just saying those things b/c they might lead to a lighter sentence. If that's the case you will go to prison.
