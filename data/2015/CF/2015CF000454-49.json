Mick appeared by video. Attorney Cole Daniel Ruby appeared by video for Defendant Daniel J. Mick. Prosecuting Assistant District Attorney (ADA) Robert J Jambois appeared for State of Wisconsin. \n\nMatter is set for a hearing on the Wis. Stat. 974.06 Motion and Motion to Reconsider and State's Motion for Summary Dismissal.\nCourt has reviewed the Order denying the request for reconsideration, motions and responses that have been filed along with the supporting affidavits and documentation.  Court has also reviewed the trial transcript. \nAtty Ruby indicates he does not have any additional information other than what was submitted in his motion and briefs and would respond to any questions the court has. \nCourt informs Atty Ruby with regards to the memory stick that was submitted and having not reviewed that for the reasons stated.  \nCourt questions Atty Ruby regarding allowing text messages and what would happen if those were allowed in. \nAtty Ruby responds. \nAtty Jambois makes arguments to the court.  \nAtty Ruby responds.  \nCourt questions Atty Ruby further. \nAtty Jambois makes additional arguments. \nAtty Ruby makes additional arguments. \nCourt questions Atty Ruby. \n\nBY THE COURT:  Court still believes the state's analysis is the correct analysis.  The court's initial decision was the correct decision.  Court will supplement that today.  \nWith regards to:\n*Newly discovered evidence - Court does not believe that the evidence is particularly exculpatory but is in fact more inculpatory.  Court cannot find it meets factors the defendant must prove by clear and convincing   evidence.  The evidence was not discovered after conviction.  \n*Negligence in seeking the evidence - Court cannot say he was negligent.\n*Material issue to the case - More material to the states theory than the defendants because subsequent actions is contrary and even admitted to by the defendant. \n*Evidence cumulative - Court finds the evidence is not cumulative evidence.\n*Deficient performance by his attorney - Court finds the burden has not been shown and there's a reasonable probability that the outcome would be different.\n*Unused evidence by the defendant for attacking credibility or bias of Christina or motive of Christina to get the child to lie about assaults - Court finds defense counsel did an adequate job of impeaching Christina for credibility and bias. The additional unused facts, as described by counsel, were more the same type of evidence and defense counsel was fairly successful in drawing the jury's attention to the bias that Christina had.  \nCourt reviews the testimony of the defendant and Christina.Court finds any jury applying common sense would appreciate that the child's mother would be expected to be bias. Testimony of the child was an original part of the court's decision. \n*Hazeltine violations - Court does not change it's decision on that.  Court finds there were no Hazeltine violations.  No prejudice to the defendant that would change the outcome of the trial. \n*Defense argument and transcript - Court finds there was not a great possibility that the jury abdicated its fact finding role to the witness and did not independently find the defendant's guilt.\n*Other acts evidence - Court has already addressed that.  Court finds, even without the greater latitude, evidence would have been admissible based on the allegations of both offenses charged.  Court finds there was no deficient performance for not raising an objection.  The objection would have been overruled.  \n*Deficient performance of post-conviction counsel - Court finds there was no deficient performance by trial counsel and had no prejudicial effect.  \n*Incorrect in applying stronger statute - Fails for a number of reasons.  Court did not deny motions solely because of clearly stronger.  Court finds clearly stronger is not a determining or mandatory factor.  Court stands by its original analysis.  \n*Definition of cumulative - That is an evidentiary rule. C Court finds the unused evidence that the defendant counsel has request is additional evidence of bias or motive was sufficient and reasonable was done by counsel.  \n\nIn conclusion, court denies the defendants post conviction motion based on prior ruling and as supplemented by today.  Newly discovered evidence was not newly discovered. Court does not find that trial or appellate counsel were constitutionally defective.  \n\nAtty Ruby makes statements as to what has not yet been addressed regarding production of cell phone for forensic examination by a defense expert. \nBY THE COURT:  Court, based on its ruling, is denying that. \n\nAtty Ruby will prepare the order consistent to the courts ruling. \n\n","parties":[],"descr":"Hearing","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000454-181","ctofc":"Eagon, Thomas B.","date":"2020-12-22","courtRptr":"Sosnowski, Cathy"},{"addlTxt":"State's Reply to Defendant's Response to State's Motion for Summary Dismissal (sent to Br 1 Judge on 12/16/2020 sp)","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000454-180","ctofc":"Eagon, Thomas B.","date":"2020-12-16","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Brief in Support of Defendant's 974.06 Motion filed by Atty Cole Daniel Ruby (sent to Br 1 JA on 12/03/2020 sp)","parties":[],"descr":"Brief","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000454-179","ctofc":"Eagon, Thomas B.","date":"2020-12-02","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Hearing on December 22, 2020 at 01:30 pm.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000454-178","ctofc":null,"date":"2020-12-02","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Daniel J.
