Probation agent Patricia Grabow appears in court. \nCourt is not aware if the state intended to appear today.   \n\nDefendant is sworn by the clerk. \nCourt questions the defendant.  \nDefendant updates her address and is living with a friend.  She just got out of a serious domestic violence situation.  There are charges for Disorderly Conduct-Domestic Abuse that are currently pending for the abuser.  She had been working at Grazie's and Hampton Inn.  She was off of work most of last year because she had medical issues.   Her hours varied between 10 to 30 hours.  After her medical issues she was then only at Hampton Inn working full-time.  She has graduated high school and received an associates degree.  She worked 3 years at a domestic shelter and worked in the medical field.  Being on probation has prohibited her from obtaining jobs.  She has a current job opening at Associated Bank but only if she's off probation.  Then also at Starbucks.  She has paperwork from Associated Bank confirming that information.  She would be working as a Customer Care Representative.  Aerotech company is the one who reached out to her because of her work history but her criminal history is an issue.  Depending on today, she could possibly start on Monday May 13th. \nCourt reviews the letter submitted by the defendant.  This letter does not provide the information for Associated Bank. \nDefendant indicates because all of her mail is general delivery, she has not received the letter that confirms that she won't be hired if she is on probation. \nCourt questions why she has paid so little on her restitution. \nDefendant indicates she did not receive short term disability while she had her medical issues.  \nCourt questions her further regarding the medical issues. \nDefendant indicates she is 100% recovered.  \nCourt questions if she has other employment opportunities.\nDefendant indicates she starts at Starbucks on Thursday.  They have medical, vision and dental insurance and will pay for her to be continuing her education to finish her bachelors degree in Human Services. \nCourt questions Atty Grabow. \nAtty Grabow makes statements.  She has only supervised her since December.  There are no violations and she is on minimum so she only comes in once every 3 months.  \nCourt indicates restitution is the big issue. \n\nBY THE COURT: \nCourt extends the defendant's probation for a period of 18 months unless she provides proof to the probation department by May 3, 2019 that she cannot be on probation and get the job at Associated Bank.  If she provides proof, probation will be allowed to terminate and civil judgments will be entered.   She did testify under oath and she could be subject to purgery.  If she cannot prove that, she is expected to make gains in the payment of restitution during the extended period.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000028-91","ctofc":"Flugaur, Thomas","date":"2019-04-23","courtRptr":"Heaverlo, Mary"},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Tracey J Loucks\nCurrent: 3000 Ellis St, Stevens Point, WI 54481 United States  (Effective: 04-23-2019)\nPrior: 1834 Monroe Street, Stevens Point, WI 54481 United States\n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Loucks, Tracey J"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000028-90","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-04-23","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"w/DOC payment history attached","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000028-89","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-04-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing on April 23, 2019 at 09:00 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000028-88","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-04-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Tracey J Loucks\nCurrent: 1834 Monroe Street, Stevens Point, WI 54481 United States  (Effective: 01-22-2016)\nPrior: 1850 Eva Road #14, Kronenwetter, WI 54455 United States\n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Loucks, Tracey J"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000028-87","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-04-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Tracey J Loucks\nCurrent: 1834 Monroe Street, Stevens Point, WI 54481 United States  (Effective: 02-23-2015)\nPrior: 6510 Bluff Road, Bancroft, WI 54921 United States\n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Loucks, Tracey J"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000028-85","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-04-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Notice of court ordered financial obligations","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000028-83","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-02-01","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Records of prosec. are converted data.
