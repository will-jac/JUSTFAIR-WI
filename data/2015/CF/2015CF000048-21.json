Daniels in court with attorney Thomas Clinton Roley.  Charles James Simono appeared for the State of Wisconsin. State - here for FPT on 15CF20 and PH on 15CF48. Roley - willing to proceed on PH. State - asks court to take judicial notice that the defendant was out on bond on 14CF20 when 14CF58 occurred. Roley has no objections. Court takes judicial notice of that. State calls Deputy Jason Novak. Novak sworn in. Direct exam by State at 9:31 AM. Record reflects proper identification of the defendant. Cross exam by Roley at 9:39 AM. State objects - relevance - Roley explains relevance - sustains (9:41 AM). Novak excused at 9:42 AM. State - believes it mets its proof for today's hearing and if Court agrees and asks for finding of probable cause and bind over - State has served TT who did not appear and if Court believes it is necessary - asks for material witness warrant. Roley responds - willing to concede probable cause for stated reasons. Court will find probable cause, binds over for trial. State files Information that mirrors the complaint. Roley has Information, waives reading of it, asks for a date for ARGN. State responds - would prefer to proceed to ARGN sometime this AM allowing Roley time to discuss the matter with the defendant.
