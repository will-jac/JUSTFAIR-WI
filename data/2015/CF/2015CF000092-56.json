Court advises DE that since there was a $2,500 cash bond ordered on 7/5/2018 that has not been posted so he will go into custody today.  DE doesn't understand.  Court explains and directs he be taken into custody pending the posting of the $2,500.00 cash bond previously ordered.  Court addresses Ludwig hearing requested and explains what that is.  State states what the last offer was that the DE was given.  DE states he never rec'd offer.  Atty Burdon states he conveyed these offers to DE.  DE wants to consider offers.  Court notes motions still before the court.  Motions to be reset.  Off the record the court sets a new MH date.
