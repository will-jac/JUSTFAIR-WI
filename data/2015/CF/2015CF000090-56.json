Atty Lawton states he got 2 CD's about 10 days ago that he was able to open up but he still hasn't had access to the CD's the State has yet to show the defense.  State addresses list of witnesses/list is coming.  Court urges disclosure sooner rather than later to avoid surprises later.  Atty Lawton questions if the State has any more CD's they haven't seen.  State says he's not aware of any further than the third CD which is subject to the protective order.  Court addresses item #3 - demand for copies of victim's cell phone records.  Parties agree the demand has been made but the State responds.  Atty Lawton responds.  Parties discuss.  Court will come back to that.  Court addresses #4 re: victim's prior knee injury/medical records.  Parties discuss turning over medical records.  Court will reset hearing to address that matter but moves on to the protective order issue.  Parties discuss.  Court will continue hearing and expects attorneys to come armed w/case law to argue their motions.  Atty Lawton states he's filing a motion to suppress today.  State has nothing further.
