State agrees but makes one clarification that the $655.00 restitution should be a cost for drug buy money and is to be paid at no less than $100.00/month. State moves to dismiss and read in counts #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #10, #11, #12, #14 and #15 on 15CF13. Court dismisses and reads in those counts. Defendant pleads G to counts #1, #3, #9 and #13 as alleged on 15CF13 and pleads G to counts #1 and #2 on 15CF101 as alleged. Court has plea qusetionnaire, goes thru it, finds the defendant has freely, voluntarily and intelligently waived his constititional rights by entering his plea and right to JT, accepts plea, adjudges guilty, proceed to sentencing. State makes final argument prior to sentencing - follow joint recommendation. Scholke makes final argument prior to sentencing - follow joint recommendation - asks for expungement. McGeshick makes statement, remorseful.
