Defendant confirms she is disputing the requests of the Agent.  Agent Peter-Garay presents statements and is asking the Court grant her request to order the defendant serve 3 months of the stayed condition time and extend probation.  Defendant presents statements and advises that she has $10.00 to pay today towards the restutition.  Court will approve the request for use of stayed condition time of 3 months and will sign the proposed order previously submitted by the Agent.  Court notes that leaves the request to extend supervision for unpaid court costs and restitution.  Court questions the defendant with regards to hours she worked and why money was not paid towards restitution.  Defendant responds.  For reasons placed on the record the Court will grant the request to extend probation for 2 years from 10/25/2019 to 10/25/2021 or until all obligations are completed and will sign the order submitted by the Agent.
