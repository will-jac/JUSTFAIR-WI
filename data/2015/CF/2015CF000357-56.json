Atty Berkos acknowledges rec. 5 count information and went over that w/his client.  Court reads all five charges and maximum penalties to the DE.  Parties discuss potential fine on Ct 5.  Atty Berkos states DE is aware of the maximum fine and if the parties discuss between now and the sentencing date that there would be no fine that the DE would benefit from that so they would not argue that.  DE agrees.  Court continues w/the max penalties for Ct 5.  Atty Berkos states an agreement has been reached and files a plea questionaire w/the Court.  Atty Berkos notes DE will enter a Guilty Alford plea to count 5 and explains the reason for that is due to possible civil issues.  State would then move to dismiss Counts 1-4.  Atty Berkos states there is a joint recommendation for a PSI and then the State wouldn't recommend more than 12 years initial confinement and the defense would be free to argue.  DE pleads Alford Plea Guilty to Count 5.  Court questions DE on plea.  DE advised of felony firearms warnings and voting rights.  State requests Court take judicial notice of transcript of jury trial in 15CF360.  Atty Berkos doesn't object.  Court takes judicial notice of transcript of jury trial in 15CF360.
