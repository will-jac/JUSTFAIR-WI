I accept Kovari's rep that it would have affected the sent argument she made. However the standard isn't whether a factor which was then in existence.  The def knew she was aware of the preg and there were family considerations that caused her to conceal this from her family and concealed - it was a strategic and wilfull decision on her part to conceal it from her counsel and the court. Secondly, I can't say that it would have been  highly relevant to the sentence. She would not be the first inmate to give birth in custody. The DOC has the responsibility of providing care to inmates and I assume w/ her and her preg that they would fulfill that obligation. As the ADA stated, it's an argument that can really cut both ways - that she should be given consideration for the child but the counter argument is that weighs in favor of prison as that would be the most effective way to protect the child but I don't know if I would have considered either of those to be highly relevant at sentencing.
