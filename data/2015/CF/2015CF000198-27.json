Exhibit 2 - CD with 38 photos - Witness testifies to photos in exhibit.  Her parents, defendant, her boyfriend & herself, and their children were at the house.  Brought beer to victim's home with them.  Her parents left at one point leaving her, Steven, defendant and victim.  Did not know at the time someone was asleep in one of the bedrooms.  Happy atmosphere when everyone arrived at Reggie's house.  Victim did not smoke marijuana while they were there.  Michael was looking at the automatic rifle and he had ejected a round and describes how he did that.  Doesn't recall him handling the magazine at this time.  Her fianace told her he had unloaded the guns in the house.  Reggie was intoxicated when they got there.  Didn't know of any medical issues he had.  Reggie wished Michael a happy veteran's day when he got there.  Steven was circulating around in the house.  Don't recall seeing Michael pick up a round or anything off the floor.  Witness states she asked about victim's daughter and he got pretty emotional.  I didn't want the kids to see him emotional so decided it was time to go.  Steven went out to warm up vehicle and she got the kids ready to go.  When at the door trying to get the kids outside, just barely outside and heard a gunshot.  Told daughter to go to dad and went back into the house.  DA shows witness Exhibit 1 - Diagram of layout of house and she testifies to location of subjects.  Michael was standing near coffee table and Reggie was on couch laying back on couch; gasping for air.  Michael was standing there with his hands behind his back.  Didn't see a weapon.  Initially thought there was a shot into the floor.  Michael said he shot him but told me to call 911.  Could tell he was in shock.  Didn't hear any harsh words between the two that evening but could hear them speaking - Michael, Reggie, and Steve.  Trying to get kids out the door wasn't aware of what Michael was doing.  She went down first flight of stairs and screamed for Steven.  At first, he didn't believe me.  I was crying and in shock.  Interviewed that morning by law enforcement.  Michael was graduated and was looking for employment.  Recently served in Iraq.  Feels Michael was intoxicated at the time.  She was trained in hunter safety.  Never shot anyone..... Objection by defense.  Sustained.  Could see blood on Reggie's chest.  Didn't see any blood on Michael. Busy looking after kids so don't recall everything going on.  Michael had locked the door and couldn't get back in.  Cross-examination by attorney Matousek.  He was like a dad to her.  His daughter got into drugs and caused anxiety and sadness for Reggie.  Close relationship with Reggie and her parents as well.  Known Michael for about 10 years - he's fun, patient, caring.  Steven asked Michael to help with insulating porch.  He arrived and she went out hunting.  They went out to help find deer she though she hit.  They all came back to house and before making dinner went to her parents.  Invited them for supper.  She, children, and mother went to Warren's Mall and bought some wine.  Went back home, made dinner, and they all ate.  Got frustrated with Steve not helping with kids and took out on Steve and Michael.  Michael is never the hot head.  They started drinking after supper around 6 p.m.  Had gone through a 24-pack of beer and went to get more at the Warren's Mall.  Reggie and R.B. pulled up and they were pretty intoxicated.  Later Reggie said they'd been on a 2-day bender.  Reggie told them to stop down.  Got home with beer after 9:00.  Got home Steve said he didn't want to leave as they were still trying to smoke some meat.  Got kids into pajamas, got ready to go and eventually went to Reggie's.  She wanted to go to Reggie's.  Went in 3 different vehicles.  Pulled up and could hear very loud music.  Not unsual.  Reggie let us in and he was happy.  She describes the condition of the home and what she was concerned about with the kids there.  Michael would go outside as he smokes when he drinks.  Steven also went outside some.  Reggie got on floor and played with kids.  Her parents weren't there very long.  Wasn't unusual for Reggie to have guns around the house and had quite an arsenal - loves guns.  The AR was his pride and joy.  Getting ready to leave.  Michael said to give him a minute.  Can't determine length of time between going down the stairs and hearing the gunshot.  A gun had been shot into the floor at some previous time per Reggie.  She thought that's what happened.  Michael calmly told her to call 911, but his eyes were frantic.  He locked the door so they couldn't get back into the house.  Michael had already put a coat on Reggie's chest to probably put pressure on wound.  Re-direct by DA Fox:  Jacket was a green fleece, army fleece Michael wore that night.  He's not rendering any aid when she saw him.  Michael knew Reggie for about 5 years.  Didn't go there regularly like they did.  Knew him as Steven's brother.  Re-cross by Matousek:  Did not see him render aid.  She will remain under her subpoena.  May leave courthouse today.  State calls next witness, S.N., sworn, testifies.  Defendant is his brother, ID's defendant.  Saw Michael handle the AR - pull action open, bullet fell out on floor, pulled out clip, released action.  He told Reggie, you know it's loaded and Reggie just gave him a look.  Seemed like he was going to put it back the way it was but I told him to leave it unloaded.  Set it on the ground with clip next to it on the floor.  Witness testifies to photos in Exhibit 2.  Fiance came out screaming, told her to get in car.  Ran to house and door was locked.  Michael came to door and told him to call 911 and that Reggie was shot.  They all left and went to her parents and he made the 911 call.  During the call found out his brother had also called.  Michael served in military for 8 years and was starting his 2nd term. Also recently graduated from police academy.  Had seen him handle guns maybe twice.  He'd been to Reggie's 5 - 8 times over 10 year period.  Believed Michael was intoxicated, shouldn't have handled firearms, or drive himself home.  Cross examination by attorney Matousek:  Begged him to come down to help him with remodel project.  He is very close with his brother.  A lot of military background in their family.  Knew Reggie for 10 - 11 years and were very close.  He was a great person.  Would help anybody.  He was a gun enthusiast.  He would shoot every weekend and have people over for cookouts.  Michael was going to school and was working at Menards Distribution Center part-time.  He lived in Eau Claire with their grandfather, 86 years old.  Michael got there about 3:30 - 4:00.  Worked on project, went to look for deer.  Describes when he had an accidental discharge of a gun when hunting.  Went to Reggie's about 12:00, 12:15 a.m.  Loud music playing.  Everyone goes into house.  People were milling around, getting beer, going out to smoke.  Busy watching kids.  Knew Reggie was intoxicated.  When Michael is intoxicated he opens up more, he's a quiet guy otherwise, doesn't act out.  Heard gunshot when he was in car with engine running.  Sounded like a loud thump.  Fiance came out screaming and said Reggie was shot.  I went to door but couldn't get back in.  He told me to call 911.  Told him to let him in as he's certified in first aid and CPR.  Called 911 before we were out of the driveway.  Re-direct by DA Fox.  Never owned AR.  Witness is excused and is released from subpoena.  Will start at 8:30 tomorrow morning due to predicted weather in afternoon.  Judge admonishes jurors to not discuss the case. Jury out.  Discussion of plan for tomorrow as far as witness testimony.  DA Fox will hold onto Exhibit 2 until testimony by another witness tomorrow.  He will refer to image numbers during testimony.  Back on record with jury out.  A juror told a bailiff they are worried they will loose a temp job by serving 5 days.  Juror brought into courtroom to explain the situation.  Counsel has no questions of juror but DA Fox is concerned to proceed without 2 alternates.  Attorney Matousek and his client are OK to proceed with 13 jurors.  After discussion, DA Fox does not object to continuing with 13 jurors.
