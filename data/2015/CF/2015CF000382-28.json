However then the Court and parties discuss that there is not a revocation being considered at this time.\nMr. Hasenstab clarifies that his correspondence was sent to draw the Court's attention to the fact that Mr. Kutz is not following the Court-ordered conditions of his Probation. Agent Hasenstab informs the Court that a 45 day jail-sanction has now been imposed. \nThe Court speaks with Mr. Kutz about his non-compliance and the concerns related to housing upon release; it is agreed by all that it is best for Mr. Kutz not to reside in his father's house. Agent Hasenstab will continue efforts regarding arrangements for Mr. Kutz to reside with a different family member upon his release from the jail sanction term.\nrecess 12:03pm.  \n","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-34","ctofc":"Koschnick, Randy","date":"2016-03-10","courtRptr":"Thies, Deidre"},{"addlTxt":"Request from ADA Shock that Motion be Withdrawn","parties":[],"descr":"Request","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-32","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-02-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Letter from Attorney Rhiel advising he no longer represents the defendant","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-33","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-02-18","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion hearing at 03-10-2016 11:30 am","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-30","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-02-16","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion for probation modification","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of motion, motion","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-29","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-02-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing at 03-10-2016 11:30 am","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-28","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-02-11","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Court orders a probation review hearing be set on a day other than friday. cc: all w/notice","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-31","ctofc":"Koschnick, Randy","date":"2016-02-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Notice of Failure to Comply with Court Ordered Conditions submitted by the Probation Agent","parties":[],"descr":"Notice","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-27","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-02-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"To be expunged","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-26","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-12-31","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Assessment Report","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-25","ctofc":"Robinson, Carla J.","date":"2015-12-31","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Judgment of conviction","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-24","ctofc":"Robinson, Carla J.","date":"2015-12-31","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Associated with Charge #1","parties":[],"descr":"Conviction status report","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-22","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-12-31","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Dispositional order/judgment","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-23","ctofc":"Koschnick, Randy","date":"2015-12-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Charge amended","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-21","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-12-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"with JI's/elements and criminal case settlement","parties":[],"descr":"Plea questionnaire, waiver of rights","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-20","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-12-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Appeal rights/info on postconviction relief","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000382-19","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-12-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Cases 15CF382, 15CF390 & 15CM484 called together at 1:54 pm [Clerk SH]\nDefendant Matthew R.
