Discussion about PSI - first page -penalty right - once in PSI mentions 6 month enhancer; and also note possess with intent - 2nd or sub offense in  CCAP needs to correct this as well,  Ct - straight forward Possession of THC - 2nd Offense, contrary to Sec. 961.41(3g)(e) and second, a Class I Felony.   JOC should be noted for the correct offense and and CCAP entries for what she is convicted of should be amended.  When Ct reviewed complaint - complaint did allege possess within intent to deliver, and pursuant to agreement of parties amended to possess of THC - 2nd Offense.    DA  - any other comments, just what she was convicted of on page 5, 6 and 7, and prior record.  SPD - comments of pre-sentence - nothing other than was DA mentioned.

Conditions of probation on all counts - 14CF237  - count 5 - 6 months ACJ - 180 days.  CTS 17 days - wr cc release - serving time somewhere else - if can be assured going directly from ACJ to GCJ would go along with that but when two convictions already for FTR and has 2 conv for BJ - not a good rish to trust to do things on own, may serve time in GCJ or ICSD if make necessary arrrangm't between sheriff's depart if no cost to ACJ and if she needs a furlough may be problematic.
