Lindmeier in court, in custody with Atty Travis Schwantes.    \nMatter is before the Court for a continued Motion hearing. \n\n3:52 pm  Court in recess.  \nThe Court will first address the \"Harris\" issue.  The additional information we now have is the Complaint from Waukesha County.  \nCourt has had a chance to more thoroughly review \"Harris\" and understands now that the Court found the evidence in that case not to be directly exculpatory but rather excuplatory impeachment evidence.  \nCourt asks Atty Johnson if she requests the information be disclosed?  Response by Atty Johnson.  \nCourt is requesting that Atty Johnson get this Information from Waukesha and provide it to Atty Schwantes.  \nThe Court will make the determination as to whether it can be used.  .  \nCourt next addresses the other acts Motion.  Court did review Atty Johnson's letter to the Court.  \nCourt will go through each of the paragraphs in the Affidavit.  \n\nParagraph 4:\nDiscussion between Court and Attys re:  acceptable purpose\nCourt will allow it in under motive and context \n\nParagraphs 5 and 6:  \nDiscussion between Court and Attys re:  acceptable purpose\nCourt will allow it under motive and context\n\nCourt deals with 2nd portion of paragraph 5 (exposure)\nDiscussion between Court and Attys re:  acceptable purposes\nCourt will not allow that portion of paragraph 5\n\nParagraph 7:\nDiscussion between Court and Attys re:  acceptable purposes\nCourt believes it is pretty clear that it deals with motive and intent\nCourt will allow it under those 2 purposes.  \n\nParagraph 8:  \nDiscussion between Court and Attys\nAtty Johnson reads portions of interview transcripts into the record.  \nAtty Schwantes asks that it not be found as an acceptable purpose under the first prong.\nCourt thinks it is a signifcant connection with \"poop\"\nCourt will allow it for \"context\" only\n\nParagraph 9 is just a statement and Court does see it as an other act.  \n\nSTEP 2 (relevance) and STEP (3) Does probative value substantially outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice.\nSome of the things to consider are nearness in time, place and circumstance.  \nResponse by Atty Johnson as to nearness in time.  \nResponse by Atty Schwantes as to nearness in time.  The only one that he thinks has a specific time is the one identified in #7.\nAtty Schwantes indicates his argument isn't on the 2nd prong on any of these, but indicates his argument is on the third prong.  \nCourt makes findings as to nearness in time and the circumstance, distinctive traits involved, lack of frequency of these events within society.\nArgument by Atty Johnson regarding step 3 (prejudice)\nCourt makes findings.  Greater latitude rule has to be taken into consideration.  \nCourt does not believe the concerns of the defense substantially outweigh the danger of unfair prejudice.  \nThe Defendant will have the opportunity to rebutt the evidence.  The Court will give a cautionary Instruction to the Jury.  \nCourt will allow the other acts evidence for all the reasons set forth.  \n\nShiffra-Green issue:  Dealing with counseling, treatment, psychiatric and psychological records of complaining witnesses (A.C.F)\nAtty Schwantes is still asking for records relating to both children.  \nCourt asks how Atty Schwantes obtained the information referenced in his Motion.  \nAtty Schwantes indicates most of the information came from the CPS report.  \nAtty Schwantes is asking the court to review the records.  \nCourt believes Shiffra only deals with the victim and not with a witness.  \nAtty Schwantes does not think the Court is wrong on this.  \nCourt does note that the witness could be considered an \"uncharged\" victim.  \nResponse by Atty Johnson that she had thought about charging it.  \nShe has no objection to Court doing Shiffra analysis as to both children.  \n\nCourt notes we are dealing with the relevancy component of the Shiffra Green standard.\nCourt understands that the Defense's position is that some of the conduct that is attributed to ACF in paragraph 11 could constitute PTSD and could be related to the prior case and not this case.  \nAtty Schwantes argues that relevancy is for impeachment.  Response by Atty Johnson.  \n3:36 pm  Continued discussion between Court and Attys.  \n3:45 pm  Court needs something from Atty Schwantes tying up the symptoms that he knows of that could be related to PTSD and that could impair a victim's ability to recall or describe.  Court needs something that says this sort of projection from one perpetrator to another could occur over a 5 year period.  Response by Atty Schwantes.  Court will take this Motion under advisement unless and until Atty Schwantes submits any additional information.  \n\n3:47 pm  One last matter is the State's Notice of Videotaped Statement of A.C.F.  Court asks Atty Schwantes if he is going to stipulate to use of the videotaped statement.
