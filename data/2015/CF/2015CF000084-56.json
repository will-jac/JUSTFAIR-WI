Court notes State's motion in limine re: expert Peterson and motion re: pre-accident witnesses are what is set to be addressed today.  Atty Albrecht agrees that is what is it to be addressed/notes Daubert hearing is set for a week from today to address that motion.  Atty Miller states he thought they were just going to do the three vehicles today.  Court takes up Peterson motion first.  Atty Albrecht notes they have received only a paltry description of what the testimony will be.  971.23(2m)(am) is the legal basis for State's motion re: Peterson.  Atty Miller responds re: computer animation.  Atty Albrecht objects as to foundation comments by Atty Miller.  Court questions parties re: dates documents were received.  Parties argue relevance of testimony as it hasn't been provided yet.  State feels it should be excluded as it's untimely.  Atty Miller responds.  State requests date certain set if the Court will not exclude the witness.  Atty Miller responds/will be meeting w/witness on Friday and could find out then.  Court suggests he get two views from the witness when he meets w/him re: when he can provide the animation in question.  Court advises Atty Miller that if he feels he needs more time for trial he should file a motion.  Court denies the State's motion re: testimony of Peterson at this time.  Any animation to be used during trial to be disclosed to the State not less than 48 hours prior to trial.  Court states other motion to be addressed re: vehicles who witnessed accident.  Atty Miller makes statement re: vehicles and where they were when they passed the DE's vehicle.  Atty Spoentgen responds re: statements provided.  Court questions parties re: which vehicles are in question.  Atty Miller notes pictures on State's monitor he has not yet received.  Atty Miller will go back and check his CD's to make sure he doesn't have them.  Court advises Atty Miller to let DA know tomorrow if he needs those photos still.  Court excludes testimony of the Coppernoll's as it goes to the State's case in chief.  Will reserve decision later re: possible rebuttal testimony.  Atty Miller addresses three ladies also being called.  Atty Spoentgen responds/they can testify as they were in the vehicle which is the subject of count 9.  Court will permit the testimony of the three ladies.
