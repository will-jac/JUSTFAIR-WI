Charles James Simono appeared for the State of Wisconsin. Called at 1:03 PM. Called 15CF70, 16CF29 and 16CF52. State - here for sentencing after receiving PSI. State and counsel are prepared to proceed and both have received a copy of the PSI. State - no amendments, changes or modifications needed as far as he is concerned. Limbeck - does not believe anything dramtically affects his client refers to page 14 in regards to someone being deceased, clarifies the record. Court so notes but does not think it makes any difference in regards to the PSI. No testimomy today, just argument by counsel. State makes a remark in regards to it looks like the only order for PSI was on 15CF70 and that is the only case that a PSI was done on. Limbeck notices that as well now that the State has brought it to his attention. Both parties will be referencing the minutes from the 7/25/17 in regards to sentence recommendations. After further discussion, parties remember that the PSI was only supposed to be done on 15CF70 and they had an agreement on the other two cases, 16CF29 and 16CF52. Court agrees and will proceed today. State makes final argument prior to sentencing recommendation - on 16CF29 - 180 days jail - ordered first with prison term to run consecutive to this case - State asking for consecutive time but defense is free to argue for concurrent time; 16CF52 - withhold sentence and place on probation for 2 years - consecutive to 15CF70 - with defense free to argue on concurrent or consecutive. Limbeck agrees. State - sentencing on counts #1 and #6 on 15CF70 - State recommends 7 years in the WI State Prison System consisting of 2 years of initial confinement followed by 5 years of ES; on count #3 - 3 years in the WI State Prison System consisting of 1 year of initial confinement followed by 2 years of ES; on 16CF52 - asking for the probation to run consecutive to the ES for stated reasons - continues making argument for his recommendations. Court has question on State's recommendations in regards to 15CF70, clarifies that the prison time requested on that case is concurrent or consecutive to each other. State - concurrent to each other. Limbeck makes final argument prior to his recommendations - recommends conditional jail time and time to report to allow him to serve his sentence in the Shawano County Jail. Williams makes statement, has people in Court today that would like to speak on his behalf. Recess to allow parties to decide if someone will speak on the defendant's behalf. Back on record at 1:46 PM. Court allows Judy Murphy to make statement to the Court on behalf of the defendant. Murphy makes statement. Williams makes an additonal comment. Court sentences the defendant to the following: 15CF70 - counts #1 and #6 - 7 years in WI State Prison System consisting of 2 years of initial confinement followed by 5 years of ES - concurrent to each other, count #3 - 3 years consisting of 1 year of initial confinement plus 2 years of ES - concurrent to counts #1 and #6; 16CF29 - count #1 - 180 days in FC jail - concurrent to 15CF70, 16CF52 - place on probation for 2 years - concurrent to ES on 15CF70; court costs on all counts on all cases, submit DNA sample on all counts on each case, no possession of firearms, no voting, right to appeal, not eligible CIP but is eligible for SAP, right to appeal, set aside bond forfeiture in 16CF29 and use any bonds posted to pay costs/remainder due in 60 days/CJ, credit can be determined by counsel, adjourned.","parties":[],"descr":"Sentencing hearing","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000070-114","ctofc":"Kussel, William F., Jr.","date":"2017-11-07","courtRptr":"Kubowicz, Sherri"},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Gary S Williams Sr\nCurrent: 117 West Main Street, Bowler, WI 54416 United States  (Effective: 11-07-2017)\nPrior: 204 East Main Street, Bowler, WI 54416 United States\n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Williams, Gary S, Sr"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000070-113","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-11-07","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Gary S Williams Sr\nCurrent: 204 East Main Street, Bowler, WI 54416 United States  (Effective: 09-28-2017)\nPrior: 316 West Third Street, Shawano, WI 54166 United States\n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Williams, Gary S, Sr"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000070-112","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-09-28","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"from DE attorney (new address for DE)","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000070-111","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-09-27","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Pre-sentence investigation filed","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000070-110","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-09-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Order for pre-sentence investigation","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000070-109","ctofc":"Kussel, William F., Jr.","date":"2017-07-25","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Sentencing hearing on November 7, 2017 at 01:00 pm.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000070-108","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-07-25","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Gary S Williams in court with attorney George Andrew Limbeck.

State and Williams agree. State moves to amend count #2 to misd bail jumping contrary to 946.49(1)(a). Court amends count #2 to misd bail jumping after hearing no objections to that amendment. Defendant understands what it means for a count to be DRI. Thru the plea questionnaire, defendant pleads G to counts #1, #3 and #6 as alleged; pleads NC to count #1 on 16CF29 and pleads NC to count #1 as alleged on 16CF52 and count #2 as amended on the record. Court dismisses and reads in counts #2, #4, #5, #7, #8 and #9 on 15CF70, dismisses and reads in count #2 on 16CF29 and dismisses and reads in counts #3 and #4 on 16CF52. Court goes thru plea questionnaire, finds the defendant has freely, voluntarily and intelligently waived is constitutional rights by entering his plea and right to JT, accepts plea, adjudges guilty, continues bond on all cases and orders a PSI. Court sets all cases for sentencing hearing. Defense puts new address on the record.
