Previously hearing the DOC recommendation had changed, court asked DOC agent to file an amended Revocation Summary, court will proceed without it. Carroll indicates he does have a copy of the amended revocation paperwork and received it a couple days after the last hearing. Carroll reads what the amended revocation paperwork says - supervisor confirms recommendation of one year in the county jail. Court questions if the counts would be concurrent or consecutive.  State is recomending on count 2 - 3.5 years in the WI Prison System with 1.5 years of initial confinement  and 2 years of extended supervision. On count 6 - 4 years in the WI Prison System with 2 years of initial confinement and 2 years of extended supervision, to run concurrent to each other but consecutive to misd. charges, believes 229 days credit, makes statement to why this is their recommendation and asks that defendant not be eligible for programming until his first year is served. Carroll makes statement, asks to follow DOC recommedation of one year in FC jail. Court puts on the record that the amended revocation paperwork was filed in 19CM85. Carroll puts on the record that defendant is also being revoked on that case and should have been on the court docket for today. Court reviews file. Seifert indicates the 19CM85 was an imposed and stayed sentence. Discussion between parties regarding credit, the imposed and stayed sentence, warrant for non-payment. Soman makes statement. Court has considered statement of counsel, defendant, considered DOC revocation paperwork, on count 2 - Imposes 3.5 years in the WI Prison System with 1.5 years of initial confinement and 2 years of extended supervision. Carroll interupts court to clairify an issue the court brought up. On count 6 - imposes 3.5 years in the WI Prison system couns 2 & 6 will be concurrent to each other but consecutive to the sentence in 19CM85, court also addresses warrant - commitment time will be consecutive to each sentence and encourages defendant to pay commitment order as soon as possilbe. In 15CF42 - unpaid fines to be taken from prison wages/accounts and at the maxium amount allowable. Any amounts not paid after sentence a commitment order may be imposed on each count.

Carroll is attempting to call Agent Skallerud. Seifert would object to the changes as stated by Carroll for stated reasons. Carroll would not have any objections to an adjourment to get the necessary paperwork. Seifert has no objections to an adjournment but asks why the late change. Carroll responds. PO Agent Ron Skallerud now appear via phone (10:12 AM). Court asks Skallerud about the new offer. Skallerud responds, the new recommendation was approved by his supervisor and apologies for the delay and states reasons for the delay, new recommendation from DOC is now 1 year in FC jail as opposed to the original offer of a bifurcated prison term. Seifert would be arguing for a prison term. Carroll responds. Court makes statement, considering adjourning the manner for stated reasons.
