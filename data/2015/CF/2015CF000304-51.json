Hayes in court via telephone.  Rebecca L Sommers appeared for the State of Wisconsin via telephone.  Court Reporter: Patricia Schaefer.  Transcript filed: 01-12-2016 vw. \nThe Court has received two communications that need to be attended to at this time. The Defense is admonished to not disclose full names of minor victims in any correspondence. The first letter is dated 9/18 requesting that the DNA analysis of RM. Defense asked that his expert be allowed to test the DNA. Mr. Hayes indicates that his expert is not able to test the DNA and asks that the State test the DNA.  Ms. Sommers was contacted by defense counsel essentially telling the State to test the DNA. The State indicates they got a warrant for the DNA, they took 2 swabs and sent one to the State Crime Lab and one is at RPD awaiting pick up by the Defense expert.  The Court informs that by this action, he is waiving his right to have an independent study of the buccal swab that was retained.\n\nBTC: The State has taken appropriate action and sent the DNA to the crime lab. The State, under rules of discovery will disclose the results to the defense. The defense, by this action, is waiving his right to conduct independent testing of the DNA. \n\nThe Court has also received a letter from Mr. Hayes and the Court recalls denying request previously. The Court does not, and will not, read any gratuitous letters from either party.\n\nBTC: The matter as requested in the second letter is taken under advisement once all transcripts are received","parties":[],"descr":"Telephone conference","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-131","ctofc":"Gasiorkiewicz, Eugene A.","date":"2015-09-23","courtRptr":"Schaefer, Patricia"},{"addlTxt":"In support of motion","parties":[],"descr":"Affidavit","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-130","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-23","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ATTY Hayes files motion to use defendant's notice of learned treatises","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of motion, motion","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-129","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-23","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ATTY Hayes files notice of motion and notice of learned treatise for Court to take Judicial notice.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of motion, motion","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-128","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-23","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"From ATTY Hayes re: case.","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-127","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-23","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"From Atty Dr. Williams Hayes re: enclosed affidavit","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-420","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Transcript of Hearing held 08-10-2015","parties":[],"descr":"Transcript","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-378","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Cover Letter with AFS","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-126","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"S.F.","parties":[],"descr":"Affidavit of service","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-125","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"A.B.","parties":[],"descr":"Affidavit of service","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-124","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"K.M.","parties":[],"descr":"Affidavit of service","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-123","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"with discovery attached","parties":[],"descr":"Memorandum","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-145","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-21","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"cover letter","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-144","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-21","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"from Dr. Hayes, in response to ADA Sommers' drafted Order.","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-122","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-21","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"corrected orders from Dr. Hayes-the previous ones sent on Friday had a typo on them.","parties":[],"descr":"Notes","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-121","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-21","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"from Mary Beth Arnett, GAL, re: genetic testing.","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-120","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-18","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"from Dr. Hayes re: DNA sample of Ruben Murry.","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000304-119","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-09-18","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Proposed Orders (6) have been received from Dr. Hayes.

Hayes.  Defendant Gregory J Murry in custody.  Rebecca L Sommers appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Court Reporter: Maggie Techert.  Transcript filed: 10-29-2015 vw.\nThe Court reviewed the follow up interview of LB. It does meet all the statutory requirements. Parties give argument. The State asks that the Court conduct a colloquy with the defendant regarding Miranda/Goodchild and his right to a hearing and the Court does so. Defense has previously withdrawn their motion for suppression of defendant's statement.\nDefense had their own expert review the DNA report but their expert needs 14 specific items yet from the crime lab. Defense expert, however, does not believe they can complete their review by the trial date. Defense asks for a DNA sample from RM.  Defense motions the Court to adjourn trial. Defense brings motion to sever all counts relating to RM from all counts relating to LB. The State objects to severance and believes the counts should be tried together. Defense would like representatives of the school district to submit information. The Court will allow the filingof the documents.  The School district 118.125(f) limits the purpose of the records for the Court. Susan Fishbain, for RUSD provides a copy of the report of her evaluation of a report as received from Mr. Hayes. Defense marks Ex #1-cover letter, #2-report regarding school behavior or RM and #3-IEP of RM and report of Susan Fishbain.  The defense is asking the Court to order the State to provide any statements of LB and any potentiall contradictory statements. Regarding point #12, the State indicates the Court already denied that request as no such records exist.\n\n\nBTC: The Court will allow a redacted version of the report of the female, LB. In regards to the follow up interview, it will be admissible w/o redaction and may be used in trial.. The defendant freely, knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waives his righ to a Miranda/Goodchild hearing. The State may use statements made by the defendant on 1/30 & 2/26 in their case in chief and in rebuttal. The State is to provide whatever she can get from the State Crime lab that is on defense list.  If some of them cannot be provided, a statement is to be provided by the State Crime Lab that these items are not available or they do not exist. The State is to turn any crime lab reports or informatoin they receive within 48 hours of receipt. A buccal swab is to be taken of RM within the next 48 hours; to be done by a law enforcement officer and be provided to Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hayes agrees that the chain of custody stops with him. Gregory Kowal will pick up the buccal swab for Mr. Hayes. Motion to dismiss is denied. Motion with respect to severance is denied. The Court has not yet determined the issue of learned treatises. The Court will make the determination if the records will be disclosed or not. #12 has been previously denied and remains so. Mr. Hayes paralegal may sit with him but she will NOT be allowed to address the Court, address a witness or present herself as a licensed attorney. She is only here to help Mr. Hayes.  Trial may be adjourned. MIL by the defense and all pretrial motions to be filed with the Court 48 hours prior to final pretrial. The Court will get an order to parties as to what is allowed and what is rejected.

Hayes.  Defendant Gregory J Murry in custody.  Rebecca L Sommers appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Court Reporter: Patricia Schaefer. TRANSCRIPT FILED 09-22-2015/tk\nGAL Laufenberg and GAL Arnett are present. The State, as a procedural matter, indicates that they are not sure any further testimony is necessary as defense already got the records. Based on testimony previously given, the State believes that they met the threshhold for an in-camera review by this Court. Defense asks for in-camera review as well. Ms. Arnett and Ms. Laufenberg were both provided with a transcript from the previous hearing and they agree that the records should be reviewed in-camera. The State is only conceding with regards to RM. Ms. Laufenberg indicates with other records that may be requested, she is not conceding. Defense is asking for health care records for LB, HSD records and school records. The State, along with Ms. Laufenberg, do not believe the defense has met their burden regarding the HSD records. The issue brought up by Defense is redundant as Br 4 is handling the juv records with respect to disclosure/non-disclosure of HSD records. BTC: Request for defense to have access to HSD for LB or RM beyond what is already disclosed is denied. Defense makes a record that he does not have medical records for LB. Defense request for proof of counseling is summarily denied. Defense files document from Prof Psycholgy, pgs 299-306. Defense is also asking for school records for RM. The State objects as they do not feel defense has made a threshold showing under Shiffra/Green. Ms. Arnett joins the State's position. Defense does not have the actual record with him and asks for another date to continue exploring that. Defense calls Dr. Thompson - DSAT. Direct by the Defense. Defense marks Ex #1-article re: counseling for child witnesses. Cross xam by the State. Cross xam by Ms. Laufenberg. Defense marks Ex #1 as an exhibit for this hearing only. No objection/so received.

Ms. Arnett joins in the objection of the State. Ms. Laufenberg joins in the objection of the State. \n\nBTC: The Court will conduct an in camera review of medical records of RM. Re: therapy records that are ongoing with the victim's and possibly in the past-Under 903.03(18) Ex #1 will not be accepted as a Learned Treatise. The Court believes under 904.03 and 906.11 we are venturing into side show rather than search for truth and therefore, will not grant the right for review for in-camera with respect to mental health records and subsequent treatment records of victims. No showing has been made re: LB medical records to be reviewed in camera and therefore, that motion is denied. The Court holds open the issue of school records for both children.

Hayes.  Defendant Gregory J Murry in custody.  Rebecca Sommers appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Court Reporter: Robin Anderson.  Transcript filed: 10-13-2015 vw.  Excerpted Transcript filed: 05-19-2015 vw.\nMr. Hayes indicates the issue of his continued representation of Mr. Murry is resolved. Defense withdraws Miranda/Goodchild motion as well as search warrant of the deft's home. The State advises the Court she provided a packet of disks to defense and once it was brought to her attention, she asked RPD to prepare new disks. Ms. Sommers asked RPD to provide disks to defense counsel directly as requested to ensure the disks are complete. Defense objects as to the manner the State Ms. Sommers can provide the disk to defense. On 4/10, the Court notes the State has an open record policy regarding discovery and noted that the Court told the State the disk was to be sent to Mr. Hayes.  Defense puts issues regarding discovery on the record. The State indicates they don't intend to call the child witness in question to testify and they are not subpoena'd. Defense asks the Court to order a board certified urologist to be allowed to examine defendant in the jail. Defense has already provided information to the Court that a urologist is willing to testify to the issue of potential injury to victims. The Court indictates if defense wishes to make that defense, they may. BTC: The Court will not order a urologist to examine the defendant in the jail. Defense indicates that they sent medical records to the Court 4/13. The Court notes that they received a box of medical records but they are not certified, some are not dated or stamped. Defense indicates that they would like to see current medical records of one of the victims. Defense asks for trial to be moved to October and the Court grants that request. The Defense indicates they wish to have a Schiffra Green motion. The State objects and indicates that they do not see an analysis. The Defense has Dr. Thompson here to testify. The Court is prepared to hear the Schiffra Green motion and over rules the State's objection. Defnese calls Dr. David Thompson - DSAT. Direct by the Defense. Defense marks Ex #1-CV of Dr. Thompson. Defense moves Ex #1 into evidence/received. State marks Ex #2-professional journal article. Defense marks Ex #3-IEP form of RUSD. Counsel and court reporter were called into chambers. The Court informs defendant of the proceedings that took place while in chambers. The Court indicates that the Court will appoint a GAL for both children and the defendant nor defense attorney will be billed for those charges. Shiffra Green motion will be adjourned until August. All three exhibits are received by the Court. The State asks for clarification regarding the defense's request that the State answer line by line, the defense's request regarding specific discovery. Regarding #1-7 of the notice of motion/motion, the State indicates there is no legal basis offered for any of the items requested. \n\nBTC: GAL to be appointed for both child victims as no cost to the defendant or defense. The Court will not order the State to go line by line regarding discovery. The Court indicates the State has 48 hours to provide discovery to defense when they receive items. The State is to mail discovery items within 48 hours. The State provides defense with police reports and will have their office billed. The Court in reviewing the DVD interviews, believes that's enough to give defense sufficient basis of time to prepare meaningful defense. Regarding certain acts #1 may be testified to, #2 is covered under the rape shield law and will not be brought up in front of the jury. The officer's arrest of the defendant was proper under 968.07(1)(d). Motion to dismiss for not having an arrest warrant is denied. Motion to dismiss amended complaint and information is denied. The filing of the amended information is granted nunc pro tunc and NG plea is entered. The Court will not allow the physical or psych eval of either victim. #6 & 7 - are subject to Shiffra Green and will be dealt with at that motion hearing. #10 & 11-Discovery may be provided by HSD to defense but that doesn't mean it can be provided to the jury. The State has until June 1 to file a response to the learned treatises. MIL will be heard at FPT on 9/29. Subpoena's for RM, LM and KL are extended based on concession of defense. Defense is to prepared order. Ruling on admissibilty of DVD's is deferred to 8/10. #21 withdrawn.  Any further information Inv. Spiegelhoff has shall be supplemented to Atty. Hayes. Ruling on specific evidence will be deferred to 8/10  Motion hearing scheduled for August 10, 2015 at 01:30 pm.  Final pre-trial scheduled for September 29, 2015 at 09:30 am.
