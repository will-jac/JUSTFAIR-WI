Atty Anderson indicates that Mr. Brown has also reviewed the PSI.  Atty Anderson makes record with regard to a correction to the PSI in that the deft  acknowledged to the Probation Agent that he did have a problem with alcohol.  Atty Anderson has no other corrections or additions to the report.  \nThere were no victims that needed to be identified for today's sentencing hearing.    \n10:05 am  Atty Johnson makes record as to her understanding of plea agreement.  The sentence on each of the files would be concurrent with each other but State would argue that they be consecutive to any other sentence.  Atty Anderson confirms that agreement.  \n10:06 am  Argument as to sentence by Atty Johnson.  \n10:12 am  Argument as to sentence by Atty Anderson.  \n10:26 am  Discussion concerning sentence credit.  Atty Anderson believes that any credit he would have had has been applied against his Kenosha County sentence.  Court makes record with regard to bail that deft had on his Walworth County cases at various times.  Atty Anderson will look into this.  \n10:27 am  Statement by Deft.  \n10:30 am  Response by Deft to Court's questions.  \n10:31 am  Court proceeds with making its record and sentencing the deft.  \nAtty Anderson requests the return of the seized vehicle.
