Court finds (1) as requiring at least 3 years confinement on any defendant who is convicted for a violation of 948.12 exceptions would only apply when there is a 48 month or less age difference between the defendant and the child. Also adopt the State's reasoning that by placing A and B under 2 specifically the legislature intended both A and B to apply the option to impose a sentence of less than 3 years confinement and the option to impose probation. \nUpon questioning of the Court, Counsel indicate that the do not wish for the Court to engage in an analysis regarding ambiguity.\n\nCourt does not require a written order to be filed, but will let the record and minutes stand.
