Attorney Jon D. Seifert appeared by phone means for Plaintiff State of Wisconsin.  This matter comes before the Court regarding expungement.  The history in this matter is Mr. Goviera was sentenced in February 2016 by Judge Duvall and the Court has read the JOC and in the original JOC Doc. #14 is silent as to any issue regarding expungement.  There is an Amended JOC Doc. #20 is silent as to expungement.  The DOC in Doc. #26 filed Petition and Stipulation to waive appearance and hearing.  In that document signed by Mr. Goviera he states I have not made a good faith effort and ask the court extend my probation.  Based on that, Mr. Goviera's probation was extended DOC #28 for 1 year 0 months.  In January 2020, DOC filed notice for failure to meet expungement.  In May 2022 the same agent filed Doc. #39 Certificate of Discharge and Satisfaction for Expungement.  Mr. Seifert sent a letter to Attorney Rivard at the time, expungement was contemplated at the original negotiations, expungement allowed if successful.  The offer included both a DAGPA and Misdemeanor in the JOC.  Mr. Goviera did complete the DAGP on the felony dismissing 15CF29 11/29/2017.  On the expungement if determined whether or not the Court believes Mr. Goviera successfully completed the terms of probation, State has not objection.  State leaves in the hands of the Court buy report, expungement was contemplated back when.  If Mr. Goviera now satisfied all terms of probation, State has no objection to expungement.  Court reads 973.05 .015 1m(a) 1.  The only record at this time is the minutes.  Mr. Seifert refers to you pleading to a felony that could be expunged that is consistent with his record in his file regarding negotiations.  When you get to the judge talking in the notes, there isn't a shred of reference to expungement.  Your attorney and the State's attorney clearly talked about it but there is no record the judge said he would do it.  Court can't create expungement if the judge didn't order it at the time.  Nobody order a transcript to see.  Under Wis. 2017 WI 64 paragraph 12.  Your stipulation to extend simply said you did not comply.  The second one said you did that.  Defendant addresses the Court to explain the situation why he was extended, the restitution was joint and several and he was the youngest.  Court finds Judge Duvall did not order expungement at the time of sentencing.  You may be able to come up with a transcript that said he did.  Under State v. Ozuna, I find you did not meet the conditions of probation with the extension.  Court denies your request for expungement.  Court asks Mr. Seifert draft an order.","parties":[],"descr":"Review hearing","amount":null,"key":"46-2015CF000052-50","ctofc":"Clark, Thomas W.","date":"2022-05-23","courtRptr":"Henthorn, Ashley"},{"addlTxt":"Review hearing on May 23, 2022 at 09:30 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"46-2015CF000052-49","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-05-10","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Anthony Carl Goviera\nCurrent: N3039 Kelly Rd, Black River Falls, WI 54615 United States  (Effective: 05-10-2022)\nPrior: 321 Gilwest, Black River Falls, WI 54615 United States\n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Goviera, Anthony Carl"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"46-2015CF000052-48","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-05-10","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"DOC Supervision Fees Owing $0.00","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"46-2015CF000052-47","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-05-10","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"DOC - Balance inquiry of Obligations owing $0.00","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"46-2015CF000052-46","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-05-10","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Certificate of Discharge and Satisfaction of Probation Conditions and Expungement","parties":[],"descr":"Discharge Certificate","amount":null,"key":"46-2015CF000052-45","ctofc":null,"date":"2022-05-10","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"DOC Notice of Failure to Meet Conditions of Expungement","parties":[],"descr":"Notice","amount":0.00,"key":"46-2015CF000052-44","ctofc":null,"date":"2020-01-24","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"File Retained Electronically","amount":null,"key":"46-2015CF000052-43","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-12-26","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"DOC - Notice of Case Status Change Slip - Discharge","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of case status change","amount":null,"key":"46-2015CF000052-42","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-11-25","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Discharge Certificate.
