Upthegrove appears in custody with Attorney Mark A. Schoenfeldt.  Loralee Clark appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\nDefendant indicates he provided information to Attorney Schoenfeldt regarding the death in the family that resulted in him missing the last hearing.  Attorney Schoenfeldt did not file proof of death/funeral proceedings with the Court as instructed.  Court will hold issue in abeyance.  Defendant wishes to testify and is sworn.  Defendant advised of right to remain silent and right to testify.  Court accepts defendant's waiver of right to remain silent.  Direct examination by Attorney Schoenfeldt of Defendant James Upthegrove.  Defendant indicates he had wanted to file a motion challenging the stop of the vehicle, but that Attorney Bahnson did not file motion and had indicated that she would withdraw if defendant wanted to pursue it.  Defendant states he wanted to get out of jail and into Huber so he decided to go ahead with the plea, despite wanting to file the motion to suppress.  Cross examination by State.  Defendant understood that a new attorney could take over the case and review the motion to suppress.  Re-direct by Attorney Schoenfeldt.  Defendant believed that even if the suppression motion was not filed, that he was still entitled to the refusal hearing.  Court clarifies that defendant thought that if the suppression motion could still be filed at the refusal hearing, and if successful at the refusal hearing, overturn the plea in the criminal case.  \n(2:32- Defendant steps down from stand)  Attorney Schoenfeldt explains the position of the defendant for wanting to file a motion to challenge the stop.  State argues that this motion hearing is in regard to the post-conviction motion, not the motion to challenge the legality of the stop.  State requests a transcript of Attorney Bahnson's testimony be prepared so the Court can compare that to the testimony of the defendant today.  \nCourt orders Attorney Schoenfeldt provide written argument by June 22, 2018 at 5:00 PM.
