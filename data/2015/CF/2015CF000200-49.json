Prosecuting Assistant District Attorney (ADA) Louis John Molepske appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\nProbation Agent Patti Grabow appears in court. \n\nCourt reviews the file.   Questions the defendant regarding proof that was to be provided by May 3.  That proof was not provided by that date and her probation was extended.  On May 14, the defendant wrote a letter indicating she couldn't provide the information by May 3rd.  The court read thru additional information that she provided with that letter.  Court questions the defendant regarding where, in the information provided, it states that she cannot have a job if she is on probation. \nDefendant states that is the standard letter that they give.  She was contacted by a lady thru Aerotech and was told the information.  She also spoke to Jill at Associated Bank. \nCourt needs something that tells him that it is the probation status that is effecting her and not the fact that she is a convicted felon.  Asks if she can get someone to state that in writing.  \nDefendant indicates she goes thru Megan from Aerotech which is the staffing agency for Associated Bank.  Megan cannot put that in writing because it comes from the bank.  From what she understands, the reason they cannot word it that way is them protecting themselves from discrimination.  \nAtty Molepske and Agent Grabow have not seen the correspondence. \nCourt indicates it was scanned in to the Court file on May 14th. \nCourt questions if Megan will talk to Agent Grabow about this matter. \nDefendant does not know if she will.  She just spoke directly to her. \nCourt has made it clear what his position is.  The victim would have better chances of getting the money if she had a better job.  The court needs to know that it is the probation status and not the felony status that is preventing her from getting hired.  Court provides a copy of the correspondence to Agent Grabow.  \nAtty Molepske makes statements to the Court.  There are many cases that were dismissed and read-in.  State does not oppose that she should be gainfully employed but agrees there should be documentation so that she can be discharged and get a job.  He is skeptical due to the financial crimes and her working at a bank.  If she can provide documentation from Megan that indicates if she was not on probation then she would be employed, then the state would agree to the discharge and a civil judgment.  Asks for another due date to verify this information. \n\nCourt addresses the defendant.  The underlying crime is financial and understands she would be in customer service.  The court needs to know she will get a job at Associated Bank and that needs to be communicated to Agent Grabow either in writing or by phone.  The communication the Court received is too vague.  \nDefendant is not sure if Megan will speak to her agent.  They have put this job on hold for her from March.  If the information is provided, then the Court will allow the probation to terminate.  Agent Grabow and the defendant are to coordinate with each other.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000200-81","ctofc":"Flugaur, Thomas","date":"2019-06-14","courtRptr":"Heaverlo, Mary"},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing on June 14, 2019 at 09:00 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000200-80","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-05-20","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Letter from the defendant dated 05/11/19 in re:  documentation that had been requested by the Court to allow defendant to be taken off of probation","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000200-79","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-05-14","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Amendment to judgment of Conviction to extend probation to 11-10-2020 Counts 1 & 2","parties":[],"descr":"Amendment to judgment","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000200-78","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-05-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"09:30 AM Defendant Tracey J Loucks in court.  Probation agent Patricia Grabow appears in court. \nCourt is not aware if the state intended to appear today.   \n\nDefendant is sworn by the clerk. \nCourt questions the defendant.  \nDefendant updates her address and is living with a friend.  She just got out of a serious domestic violence situation.  There are charges for Disorderly Conduct-Domestic Abuse that are currently pending for the abuser.  She had been working at Grazie's and Hampton Inn.  She was off of work most of last year because she had medical issues.   Her hours varied between 10 to 30 hours.  After her medical issues she was then only at Hampton Inn working full-time.  She has graduated high school and received an associates degree.  She worked 3 years at a domestic shelter and worked in the medical field.  Being on probation has prohibited her from obtaining jobs.  She has a current job opening at Associated Bank but only if she's off probation.  Then also at Starbucks.  She has paperwork from Associated Bank confirming that information.  She would be working as a Customer Care Representative.  Aerotech company is the one who reached out to her because of her work history but her criminal history is an issue.  Depending on today, she could possibly start on Monday May 13th. \nCourt reviews the letter submitted by the defendant.  This letter does not provide the information for Associated Bank. \nDefendant indicates because all of her mail is general delivery, she has not received the letter that confirms that she won't be hired if she is on probation. \nCourt questions why she has paid so little on her restitution. \nDefendant indicates she did not receive short term disability while she had her medical issues.  \nCourt questions her further regarding the medical issues. \nDefendant indicates she is 100% recovered.  \nCourt questions if she has other employment opportunities.\nDefendant indicates she starts at Starbucks on Thursday.  They have medical, vision and dental insurance and will pay for her to be continuing her education to finish her bachelors degree in Human Services. \nCourt questions Atty Grabow. \nAtty Grabow makes statements.  She has only supervised her since December.  There are no violations and she is on minimum so she only comes in once every 3 months.  \nCourt indicates restitution is the big issue. \n\nBY THE COURT: \nCourt extends the defendant's probation for a period of 18 months unless she provides proof to the probation department by May 3, 2019 that she cannot be on probation and get the job at Associated Bank.  If she provides proof, probation will be allowed to terminate and civil judgments will be entered.   She did testify under oath and she could be subject to purgery.  If she cannot prove that, she is expected to make gains in the payment of restitution during the extended period.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000200-77","ctofc":"Flugaur, Thomas","date":"2019-04-23","courtRptr":"Heaverlo, Mary"},{"addlTxt":"w/DOC payment history attached","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000200-76","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-04-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing on April 23, 2019 at 09:00 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000200-75","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-04-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Tracey J Loucks\nCurrent: 1834 Monroe Street, Stevens Point, WI 54481 United States  (Effective: 01-22-2016)\nPrior: 1850 Eva Road #14, Kronenwetter, WI 54455 United States\n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Loucks, Tracey J"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000200-74","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-04-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Tracey J Loucks\nCurrent: 1834 Monroe Street, Stevens Point, WI 54481 United States  (Effective: 06-05-2015)\nPrior: 6510 Bluff Road, Bancroft, WI 54921 \n","parties":[{"sealed":false,"name":"Loucks, Tracey J"}],"descr":"Change of address notification","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000200-72","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-04-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Notice of court ordered financial obligations","amount":null,"key":"49-2015CF000200-70","ctofc":null,"date":"2019-02-01","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Records of prosec. are converted data.
