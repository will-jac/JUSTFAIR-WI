Geier appeared.  Defendant's mother is also presen as well as the victims in this case.  \nCourt notes deft has been brought back to court repeatedly to find out why Mr. Geier is not making payments.  Court has a letter from Agent Wolff stating she had heard nothing from him, or from his Illinois probation agent.   Atty Wolff advises that she did have recent contact from Mr. Geier advising that he has applied for disability - He applied in February - and it is currently under a review process.  The Illinois Agent has not been responding to Agent Wollf's inquiries.  Mr. Geier states that Social Security has advised him that it is very likely he will receive disability.  Court advises that typically a request for disability is initially denied.  Court expresses concern that the Illinois Agent doesn't seem to be monitoring him at all.  Court is getting close to revoking defendant's ability to be under Illinois supervision and that he may need to be supervised here in Wisconsin.  There have only been 2 payments since supervision began.  Last payment was in November of 2016.  Court indicates this is not acceptable.  Deft has not worked at all since his last probation review.  His mom and dad support him.  He indicates he has back due child support of approximately $4,000.  The Victims are present in Court.  Court will put this on for review in 6 months.  Court wants to know where he is with his social security application and also see if he has made any payments.  Court asks what he does on a daily basis.  He states that he reads and tries to get by everyday.  His social anxiety makes it hard for him to do anything.  Defendant says he has tried calling the person who is supervising him in Illinois but they never contact him.  Court asks Agent to check as to whether the Court can return his probation supervision to the State of Wisconsin.  Court expects to see that Mr. Geier has made some kind of payment toward restitution and makes contact with his Illinois agent - Ms. Wolff will reach out to them as to what is going on - Ms. Geier is to show proof to Agent of social security status and all of that information.  8:46 am  Court in recess.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000325-38","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2018-04-27","courtRptr":"Matoska, Linda"},{"addlTxt":"Memo from DOC re: Pobation Review Hearing","parties":[],"descr":"Memorandum","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000325-37","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-04-24","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Records of prosec. are converted data.

Mr. Geier indicates he was unemployed and just got a job.  He says it has been a struggle getting work because of his felony convictions.  He was a golf professional and a musician.  He can no longer work as a golf professional because of his convictions.  He is looking for stable employment.  He has a child on the way.  He has been living with his parents.
