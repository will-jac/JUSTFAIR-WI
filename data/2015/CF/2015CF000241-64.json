Case called.  Appearances given.  \nADA Matthew R. Leusink appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  \nDefendant Anthony W. Dellach in court, in custody with Atty Anthony N Flitcroft.  \nMatter is before the court on a sentencing after revocation on two cases.  \nAtty Flitcroft has reviewed materials from DOC and has 1 correction in 14CF207 which has incorrect dates as to deft's period of confinement.  \nAtty Leusink has no corrections.  Parties do have a joint recommendation as to sentence.  \nAtty Leusink makes record as to compliance with victim's rights. \n11:03 am  Atty Flitcroft confirms the agreement of the parties.  \n11:04 am  Deft does not wish to make a statement.  \n11:04 am  Court makes record and sentences defendant:  \n\n15CF241 - Ct #1:\nTotal length of sentence is 4 years WSP;  \n2 yrs IC followed by 2 yrs ES, conc. with 16CF64 but consecutive to any other sentence deft is serving.  \n184 days of sentence credit;  \nCourt finds defendant is Eligible for CIP and SAP;  \nConditions of extended supervision shall be the same as the original conditions of probation.  \n\n11:08 am  Discussion concerning sentence credit.  Atty Flitcroft states that the total days of sentence credit between all 4 files of Mr. Dellach is 1038 days.   \nCourt doesn't believe it can apply it toward the imposed and stayed sentence.  \n\n11:10 am  Response by Atty Flitcroft.  Deft went to Dodge Correctional on June 7th on his other files.  Continued discussion between Court and Attorneys as to sentence credit.  Court notes that defendant served the conditional time on 14CF207.  11:18 am  Court goes off record to further discuss sentence credit with the Attys.  \n\n11:23 am  Court back on record.  Same appearances.  Parties have agreed that deft is entitled to credit for the six months conditional time he did on file 15CF241.  So he is entitled to sentence credit of 184 days on both file 16CF64 and file 15CF241.  Court imposes the agreed upon sentence in each file - 15CF241 and 16CF64;  \n\n11:25 am  Court in recess.\n\n*TRANSCRIPT FILED 10/16/18 - Court Reporter : Janet Schulz","parties":[],"descr":"Sentencing hearing on revocation","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000241-61","ctofc":"Koss, Phillip A.","date":"2018-08-23","courtRptr":"Schulz, Janet L"},{"addlTxt":"Application for Jail Time Credit form","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000241-60","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-08-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Order to produce","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000241-59","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-08-16","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Sentencing hearing on revocation on August 23, 2018 at 11:00 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000241-58","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-08-01","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Atty Anthony Flitcroft","parties":[],"descr":"Public defender order appointing counsel","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000241-57","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-07-10","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Received documents","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000241-56","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-06-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Electronic Filing Notice","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000241-55","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-06-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Case Converted to Electronic Filing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000241-54","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-06-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Violation/Revocation Summary.","parties":[],"descr":"Revocation Order and Warrant","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000241-53","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-06-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Application for Jail Time Credit form","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000241-52","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-04-10","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Records of prosec. are converted data.
