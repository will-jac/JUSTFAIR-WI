Discussion about 7 days additional credit.   15CF155 - Max term was 2 years - needs to change as well.  DA - agreement to modify? - no talk about it, came to court with agreement of principle for amt of time served.  DA request - court enforce the intent of the parties.

If reach same result - sentence would go down to 74 days and cts go down to 7 days which would require him to serve 49 more days.  DA thinks he agrees with that and if court's calculations reflect that then agree, attorney agree, def agrees.  15CF18 - two issues - (1) sentence should go down to 74 days (2) cts go down to 7 days, stays consecutive to 17CF56 and any other sentences def prev ordered to serve when do amended JOC - NUNC PRO TUNC - effective as of April 12, 2017.    15CF18 - Count 4?
