ADA Bollendorf and Attorney Buker agreed that asking the law enforcement agency to issue citations for ordinance violations is not workable because the intent is that there would be nothing showing as a new-type filing.  ADA Bollendorf indicates that the conclusion has been reached that, based upon the fact that Mr. Rohland has no new violations showing on CCAP-records, the State will forego pursuing ordinance violations. \nADA Bollendorf orally Motions to Dismiss Counts #1 & #2.   \nThe Court grants the oral Motion to Dismiss Counts #1 and #2.  \nThe Court and counsel discuss the drafting of a finalizing document.

Attorney Buker states that Mr. Rohland did enough of what he was supposed to do so that she is willing to [motion to] dismiss the felony, expunge the misdemeanors, and file an Amended Complaint that amends Counts #1 and #2 to Jefferson County Ordinance Theft.
