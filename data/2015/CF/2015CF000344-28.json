If Mr. Kreklow does not make restitution and his work-release privileges are revoked because of this, Mr. Kreklow is to have his work-release privileges reinstated if he catches up in restitution payments  \n--the restitution amount that Mr. Kreklow is to pay to the victims [James Kreklow and Vickie Kreklow] is $3750 ($250 for the insurance deductible and $3,500 for increased insurance premiums).
