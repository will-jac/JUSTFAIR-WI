He was also in custody for 3 weeks and they didn't meet with him.  He went to see his agent and they wouldn't see him and didn't give him a new date.  After multiple attempts, I finally got a hold of his agent.  He was assigned a new agent.  He's always kept in contact and been in town....   I don't think the PSI is a fair characterizaton of him.  He's in jail and in constant pain.  We're requesting that he get to the hospital.  I know he's got new cases.  He's asking to have his bond reinstated.  He's never been a flight risk.  Soto-Guzman comments.  Hynek:  He's had so many chances this year and has messed.  He's only concerned with his pain and daughter when he's in front of you...  These charges have been pending since the first of this year.  He continues to pick up charges.  The cash bonds are appropriate.  Nothing should be modified at this time.\nCOURT is aware that the issues with probation and parole are problematic.   Multiple open files.  Minimun high risk.
