Defendant Robert James McGeshick in custody.  Charles James Simono appeared for the State of Wisconsin. Called at 9:34 AM. Svehlek and McGeshick have received the revocation summary, points out error in regards to a release date but it has been corrected on the face sheet and states that sentence credit is correct. Court acknowledges the mistake and makes note of it. State makes final argument prior to recommendation - puts on the record that the defendant has 288 days credit on count #8 and is going to ask for time served on that count, on the remaining counts - asking for any time sentenced to to be consecutive to count #8 but concurrent to each other and concurrent to 17CM77. Court makes statement that there is no longer a sentence on 17CM77 as it was time served. State continues with its recommendation - recommends 7 years in the WI State Prison System consisting of 3 years of initial confinement followed by 4 years of ES on the remaining counts of #4, #7 and #9. Svehlek makes final argument prior to recommendation - recommends time served on count #8, on counts #4 and #7 - 4 years in WI State Prison System consisting of 2 years of initial confinement followed by 2 years of ES, concurrent to each other, with programming ordered, count #9 - recommends 2 years in WI State Prison System consisting of 1 year of initial confinement followed by 1 year of ES - concurrent to counts #4 and #7. McGeshick withholds comment.
