The defendant understands that if the bond is returned to the poster, that he would go back into custody. Court reviews the filing. Schaefer states that she received full discovery last Thursday. The status conference today was to see if counsel would be ready to proceed to trial on 2/28/17. Schaefer states that she has not had any contact with the defendant, all appointments have fallen thru. Schaefer informs the Court why there has not been any contact yet, one time the defendant stated that he did not have a ride and he didn't show on the other appointment and she does not know why. Schaefer not really ready for JT at this point for stated reasons. The poster is present in the courtroom. If Court grants the poster's request, then the defendant would be available to meet with as he will be incarcerated. Schaefer agrees but prefers that the defendant not go back into custody. Court - no formal request for a continuance at this point but it is possible that it will be forthcoming, will know within a week, can't make that determination today. State is ready to go on for the two day trial, all witnesses have been subpoenaed. Schaefer responds, has not filed any witness list yet as she has not met with the defendant yet, does have discovery. Schaefer states that she would tentatively be able to proceed to trial if she met with her client. Court will assume that it is going to trial on 2/27/17, meet in chambers at 8:30 AM on 2/27/17 and have jury instructions filed at least 5 days prior to trial. State - general MIL. Schaefer - standard MIL as well. Court requests all parties to contact their non-professional witnesses in regards to abiding by their subpoenaes at least 5 days prior to trial. If the matter settles, Court needs to be contact no later than the morning before the trial otherwise jury costs will be assessed to a party. State expects any settlement one week prior to the scheduled JT. Court addresses the refund of the bond posted. Bond poster, Theresa Johnson, is in the Courtroom. Court questions poster in regards to the bond posted. Johnson is asking that the bond be returned to her for stated reasons and she understands that if granted, the defendant would go back into custody today. Schaefer objects to the refund of the bond or convert it to a signature bond for stated reasons. State objects to a signature bond for stated reasons, has no objections to refunding the bond, wants the $10,000.00 cash bond to stay in effect. Court grants the poster's request, refund the bond to poster, continues bond as previously set at $10,000.00 cash, defendant to go back into custody today if he does not have the money to post. State reminds counsel to contact FOSO for visits as their policies have changed.
