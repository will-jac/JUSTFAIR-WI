Prose pleadings have been received and reviewed by the Court.  \nThe State responds to the defendant's pleadings and requests that the Court deny the motion without a hearing.\nThe defendant explains his position on the motion and the problems he had with Atty Flanagan.  Defendant requests that this case be dismissed.  \nBTC:  Judge considers the States position.  The Court has reviewed the defendants files.  The Court has made a decisions and findings in these matter:\nBased on the 8th atty request and grievances the defendant filed against the atty, Atty Burris was allowed to withdraw.  The Court did find that the atty did not request to withdraw but it was an ethical conflict after the defendant filed a complaint against the attorney.  Atty Burris has withdrawn and now the defendant is representing himself.  Defendant forfeits his right to an attorney.\nThe defendant complained about videoconference appearance.  Defendant will be transported to the courtroom for the next hearing.  The Court prefers that the defendant appear in person in the courtroom.\nBTC:  The defendant has filed a motion to withdraw his plea.  There is a transcript on file re: the PLEAH.  Court has reviewed the transcript and Judge Mueller was extremely patient with the defendant and the defendants questions were answered on the record.  The Court finds that case law requires that the defendant must have a clear reason to withdraw his plea and the reasons the defendant gave were incredible.   The Court denies the motion to withdraw his pleas.  \nThe Court would be prejudiced by the withdrawal of the plea.  There have been many delays in the prosecution of these cases.  The defendants behavior has had an impact on these cases.  A lot of time has passed but a lot of the delays were because of the defendants behavior.  \nBTC:  A sentencing hearing will be set on 15CF1234 and 15CM2538.  A PSI is ordered.  Defendant states that he will not cooperate with the PSI writer.  If defendant refuses to cooperate, the State will likely come in and say that the defendant has not cooperated with the plea agreement.
