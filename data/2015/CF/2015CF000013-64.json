Case called.  Appearances given.  Haley Jo Johnson appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Defendant Genevieve S. Thornberry in court, in custody with attorney James B. Duquette.  Matter is before the Court to discuss the period of sex offender registration.   When defendant was sentenced, the Court did not indicate the length of time for sex offender registration.  The PSI writer had recommended sex offender registration.  The Court did review the string of e-mails between the Attorneys concerning this.  With this conviction not being a \"sex offense\" under Sec. 301.45, the issue of sex offender registration was not discussed at the time of sentencing.  Discussion between Court and Attorneys as to whether the parties had an agreement to adopt the recommendations of the PSI.  Court will consider this argument as to whether sex offender registration should occur, and if so, for what length of time.  9:09 a.m.  Argument by Attorney Johnson.  9:13 a.m.  Argument by Attorney Duquette.  Court believes we need to review Sec. 301.45 (1d)(b).  Continued argument by Attorney Duquette.  Court notes there does appear to be a conflict beween Sec. 973.048(1m)(a) and 301.45(1d)(b).  Response by Attorney Johnson as to the distinction between the statutes.  Court believes it can justify the difference between \"shall\" and \"may\".  Response by Attorney Duquette.  Court finds 973.048.(1m) is \"discretionary\" as to sex offender registration and 301.45(1d)(b) is \"shall\" - mandatory sex offender registration.  Argument by Attorney Duquette as to whether or the not sex offender registration should be ordered by the Court.  Further argument by Attorney Johnson.  9:33 a.m.  Court takes a recess to consider this matter and will return at 9:50 a.m. to render a decision.  9:48 a.m.  Court in session.  Attorney Duquette misspoke during his argument and wishes to make a further record.  Court makes findings as to each factor set forth in the statute.  This crime was sexual motivated conduct and sex offender registration is in the interests of public protection.  Court requires sex offender registration by the defendant for 15 years.  9:53 a.m. Court in recess.\n\n**TRANSCRIPT FILED 2/15/2017: COURT REPORTER EILEEN GRZENIA**","parties":[],"descr":"Hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000013-42","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2016-01-28","courtRptr":"Grzenia, Eileen"},{"addlTxt":"16A 023259","parties":[],"descr":"Cash bond applied","amount":980.00,"key":"64-2015CF000013-41","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-01-25","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Hearing at 01-28-2016 09:00 am","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000013-36","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-01-22","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Appeal rights/info on postconviction relief","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000013-34","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-01-11","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Application for Jail Time Credit form","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000013-33","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-01-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Dispositional order/judgment","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000013-40","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2015-12-16","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Temporary Commitment form filed","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000013-39","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2015-12-16","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Written explanation of determinate sentence","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000013-38","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-12-16","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Genevieve S.
