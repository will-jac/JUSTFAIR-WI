Haley Jo Johnson appeared as a special prosecutor for the State of Wisconsin.    Court reporter: Brady Bish.  Discovery issues still exist.  Reports were provided to the defendant.  280 pages were available.  Mr. Barker was unable to study all the reports and could not make copies of the reports.  Documents were redacted and defendant felt that the redacted documents were extensivly redacted and the defendant felt that it was against State statute  Defendant did not use all of the time available to him to review the documents.  Defendant needs more time to review the documents.  Defendant wants copies of the reports.  Judge informed the defendant that he could come and continue to review the documents.  Defendant wants copies of the reports.  State is not opposed to providing copies of the reports as long of none of the reports will be released to anyone else and not to have them posted on social media.  State will prepare the order and email them to the defendant.  State supplied a copy of  the interviews with the Cree employees on a recording to the defendant.  Defendant insists there are more tapes and the State will look into this again.  State will provide any further recordings to the defendant.\n\nIn so far as preparing for trial, Judge has received witness lists from both parties.   Defendant still needs to serve Officer Schulman.  State suggested that the defendant serve the Officers attorney by email.  The attorney will make sure his client appears for Court.  Witness lists have been exchanged.  Judge deals with legal issues.  At a trial the jury will decide if the defendant is guilty or not guilty.    \n\nLisa Beck from CREE appears by speakerphone.  This party is allowed to listen but may not speak.\n\nState has provided the Defendant with all of the tapes that are available at this time.\nMs. Schulman does not work for the County of Racine any longer.\nSgt. Mattke informs the Court that Ms. Schulman is still an employee of Racine County but she is now a Sergent.\nEric Deforte and Genella Gatzson are subpoenaed by the defendant regarding his revocation hearing.  The State believes it is irrelevant to this trial.  \nThe defendant argues as to why these State Employees should be heard.\nThe revocation hearing is not relevant to the truth of this trial as it is held in front of an Administrative Law Judge.  \nKim Winther is listed as a witness.  He is a medical examiner in Officer Schulman's case.  Information about the deceased person is redacted from the reports.  \nMr. Barker has provided voir dire questions he intends to use during trial as did the State.  Mr. Barker may have some civil questions included.  \nState will provide a hard copy of  the proposed jury instructions to the defendant.  \nState will provide the video copy to the defendant and the State will write a letter and file it with the court as to when that occured.\n\nFor the day of trial.   Judge must attend the Judicial Conference.  The new date of 11/13/18 is ok with both parties.  Mr. Barker can only be ready for trial if all of the discovery is provided ahead of time.  \nThe defendant insists that he is going to continue to represent himself.  \nThe redacted reports and the tape will be in the mail on Monday,October 29th. Defendant will need audio and video equipment available for trial.  \n\nOne last issue: On 8/1/18 a DST was filed.  Defendant is on bond.   He is not detained.  If we begin the trial in November it exceeds the DST timeline.  \nEnds of justice are served by going outside the 90 days and that there is not a miscarriage of justice by the short delay.  The interests of the victims is also served by the continuance.  \n\nCourt is adjourned.\n","parties":[],"descr":"Final pre-trial","amount":null,"key":"51-2015CF000627-334","ctofc":"Ptacek, Gerald P","date":"2018-10-18","courtRptr":"Bish, Brady"},{"addlTxt":"Emai:l to H.
