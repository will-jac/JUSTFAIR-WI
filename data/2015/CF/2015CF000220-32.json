Atty Nathan Steven Schnick.  Rukmini Vasupuram appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\nSchnick addresses the GPS.  It was removed at the VA so an MRI can be done on his knee.  He was to come back to La Crosse before surgery but he had surgery right away and is not living with his mother in Iowa.  Asks that the GPS not be required.  He can't drive.  He will have to be driven here for the PH.  We need to address whether the GPS is necessary in Iowa.  Vasupuram:  The no contact has not been lifted.  It was modified for contact in public places and 3 certain instances.  Now all of a sudden he checks him self in to the VA.  We have no proof of any of this from the VA.  This incident happened 2 weeks after his other cases were done.  I think this is a stalling tactic and feels the GPS is necessary.  Schnick:  There were serious medical issues brought on by this incident.  He was not in a good mental state whatsoever.  We're having difficulty getting info. from the VA.  No signed released to get that info.\nPH:  6/16 at 11 am    SLH\nMr. Colyer is required to sign releases for JSS so they can get info about his medical condition at the VA.  I'm not prepared to modify the bond today.  Depending on what we get from the VA, I would reconsider it at that point.  In terns of subsequent surgeries, I have concerns that these cases are going to be delayed because of that.  I don't feel the knee surgeries need to be done immediately.  Those are scheduled around other events in an individual's life.  That's not a basis for continuances.\nThe GPS will be put back on by 11 am on the 16th when he's here for the PH.","parties":[],"descr":"Calendar call","amount":null,"key":"32-2015CF000220-13","ctofc":"Horne, Scott L","date":"2015-06-08","courtRptr":"Schwingle, Jill"},{"addlTxt":"From Atty Schnick: Re: req he be allowed to keep the GPS off, had knee surgery on 5/27\nVasuparum: req hearing for clarification & before any bond modifications are made.
