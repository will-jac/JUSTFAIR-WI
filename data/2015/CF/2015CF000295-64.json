The agreement calls for Mr. Petersen to serve 25 days in Jail and pay a $100.00 fine plus court costs.  Mr. Petersen also has a pending sentencing after revocation.  The Revocation Order and Warrant has not yet been filed with the court.  Parties are requesting that Sentencing on this file will be set on the same date and time as the SEHR.  The agreement calls for the 25 days in jail to be concurrent if a prison sentence is imposed on the SEHR case, and would otherwise be consecutive.
