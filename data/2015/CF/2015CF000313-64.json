Case called.  Appearances given.  \nAndrew Robert Herrmann appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  \nDefendant Barry J Krznarich in court with attorney Jeremy J Guza.  .\nMatter is before the Court for an Oral ruling on the defense Motion to Suppress.  \nThe Court is ready to make an initial ruling but then has some questions for the Attorneys.  \nCourt makes a record as to specific facts which leads the Court to believe that Deputy Martin had reasonable suspicion to believe that a crime had been committed.  \nCourt believes Deputy Martin's testimony was credible.  Court reads portions of the transcript from the Motion hearing into the record.  \nResponse by Atty Herrmann to Court's question as to whether Deputy Martin requested the defendant to empty his pockets or was told to empty them?  \nAtty Herrmann reads further portions from the transcript into the record.  \nResponse by Atty Guza arguing that Deputy Martin was telling the defendant to empty his pockets and there was no option for the defendant.  \nCourt believes the request was dealing with the other pockets.  Court asks what was the significance of the defendant being ordered to empty pockets when Deputy Martin is conducting a Terry Stop?  \nResponse by Atty Guza.  \nCourt asks since he didn't have his hands in his pockets, does that mean the Deputy couldn't order him to empty his pockets?  \nArgument by Atty Guza.  Continued discussion between Court and Attys.  \nAtty Herrmann wasn't prepared to answer any further questions today as he believed this was just going to be an oral ruling by the Court.  Court can appreciate that and may give the Attys an opportunity to further brief this matter.   Court would like Attorneys to address Sumner and Kyles factors and brief whether the pat down or frisk was also constitutionally permitted.  Atty Guza argues there was no justification for a Terry frisk.  There was no Officer safety at issue in this case.  Court needs an answer to these questions before the Court can make a ruling.  Court is asking for further briefing on these issues.  Court asks that Atty Johnson be present at the next hearing in case there are further questions.  Atty Guza can file his brief by April 29th.  State has until May 13th to respond.  \n\nTWO ISSUES TO TO ADDRESS:  \n1)  Whether Deputy Martin's order that Mr. Krznarich empty his pockets is consititutionally permitted.\n2)  Constitutionality of the frisk - In particular, the Court is concerned that the State didn't address all of the factors in Kyles and Sumner\nCourt is finding that it was an order to empty his pockets and not a request. \nMatter set for further hearing.  \n4:26 pm  Court in recess.
