Diane M. Donohoo appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Matter is before the Court for final pre-trial.  Both sides are ready to proceed to trial.  Attorney Donohoo believes that there may be outstanding Motions that need to be addressed.  Discussion concerning D. Orth case.  Argument by Attorneys.  Attorney Donohoo wants this matter to go forward for trial.  There are witnesses coming from out-of-State.  Court believes that on its face there seems to be a valid issue here that needs to be addressed even if it was under the concept of \"reconsideration\".  Attorney Donohoo asks that the Court find that it is not relevant but if during the trial there comes a point that it becomes relevant, the Court can re-address this at trial.  Response by Attorney Schwantes.  His recollection is that the State had conceded that introduction of testimony about this complaining witness sending photos is relevant to her bias.  Atty Schwantes objects to this being brought up at final pre-trial without a motion having been filed.  Further argument by Attorney Donohoo.  Court notes that impeachment includes whether a witness possesses a bias and Court makes reference to Blinka.  Court asks \"how are you going to get this in?\"  Response by Attorney Schwantes.  Continued discussion between Court and Attorneys.  Court will contact the Court reporter from the September 4th motion hearing to get a transcript or a read-back from that hearing.  This case remains on for trial.  Court will keep the parties informed as to what it finds from the court reporter and if need be, we can have a hearing Friday afternoon.  Attorney Donohoo refers Court to the Motion filed in mid May - captioned State's Amended Motion in Limine.  Court does not find an Amended Motion in Limine in the Court file.  Discussion with regard to an incident that happened at a foster home.  Court would prefer that if an issue arises with regard to this incident, that it should be addressed outside the presence of the Jury.  Attorney Donohoo does not believe child's mother is entitled to be present in Court and should be subject to sequestration ruling.  Attorney Donohoo is relying on Sec. 906.15(2)(d).  Court believes the mother has the statutory right to be present in the courtroom.  4:26 p.m.  Court in recess.\n\n**Transcript filed 02/06/2017, court reporter Eileen Walsh Grzenia.","parties":[],"descr":"Final pre-trial","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000058-60","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2016-03-02","courtRptr":"Grzenia, Eileen"},{"addlTxt":"Substantive","parties":[],"descr":"Jury instructions","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000058-174","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-03-01","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"For Disclosure of Records","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000058-59","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2016-02-16","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"DA Service Fees Invoice #15-1459    $80.00","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000058-58","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-12-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Sheriff's Invoice #15-1171   $80.00","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000058-57","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Brian S.
