Defendant Lianne R Soman in custody.  Charles James Simono appeared for the State of Wisconsin. Called at 1:32 PM. Called 16CF84 and 16CF128. State - here for AIA on both of these matters. Court has previously advised the defendant of the charges and penalties as has Joy. Joy waives time limits, requests PH. Court continues bond on both cases at this point, 16CF84 - $750.00 cash and on 16CF128 - $10,000 cash. Joy - bond - 16CF128 - asks for reduction in bond for stated reasons, $5000.00 cash. State - bond - 16CF128 - wants significant amount of cash but does not object to lowering the bond to $5,000.00 cash. Court - bond - 16CF128 - amend bond to $5,000.00 cash with same conditions, except add a condition of no consumption of alcohol. 15CF123 and 15CF81 - Joy - 15CF81 - plead NC to count #1 as alleged, withhold sentence and place on probation for 2 years, #2 - amend to obstructing an officer contrary to 946.41, #3 - amend to county ordinance of bail jumping wioth a $500 fine plus costs, #4 - DRI; 15CF123 - plead to count #1 as alleged, 30 months probation with 90 days conditional jail time, restitution to be determined, #2 - DRI, #3 - plead as alleged with 30 months probation, #4 - DRI. State and Soman agree. State will recite probation conditions, 100 hours of community service on 15CF81 and 150 hours of community service on 15CF123 - have complied with victim notification requirements with no response received. Court - 15CF123 - court dismisses and reads in counts #2 and #4. Soman pleads G to count #1 and #3 as alleged. Court - 15CF81 - Soman pleads G to count #1 as alleged. Court - 15CF81 - amends count #2 to obstructing an officer contrary to 946.41 - reads new charge and penalty, Soman pleads G to amended count #2, Court dismisses and reads in count #4, Court amends count #3 to county ordinance of bail jumping, pleads G, finds G, fine of $500.00 fine plus costs and surcharges - 60 DTP/CO. Court has plea questionnaire, goes thru it, finds the defendant has freely, voluntarily and intelligently waived her constitutional rights by entering her plea and right to JT, accepts plea, adjudges guilty, proceed to sentencing. State makes final argument prior to sentencing - follow joint recommendation - additional conditions of probation would be AODA, no consumption of alcohol and no entry into any bars or taverns, maintain/obtain full time employment/school, 100 hours of community service on 15CF81 and 150 hours of community service on 15CF123. Joy makes final argument prior to sentencting - follow joint recommendation - 116 days credit on 15CF81. Soman makes comment, remorseful. Court sentences the defendant to the following:  15CF81 - withhold sentence and place on probation for 2 years with conditions of: AODA and follow thru, no consumption of possession of alcohol and no entry into any bars or taverns, attend at least one AA/NA or similar type meeting once per week and provide proof of attendance to P&P, maintain/obtain full time employment/school, 100 hours of community service, costs, credit to be determined by counsel (116 days credit but breakdown to be provided by counsel); 15CF123 - withhold sentence and place on probation for 30 months on each count - concurrent to each other -  with conditions of: count #1 only - 90 days in FC jail - huber allowed - eligible for community service under 973.09(7m) - credit to be determined by counsel, same conditions as 15CF81 except for an additional 150 hours of community service, costs, submit DNA sample with expunction rights given, no possession of firearms, no voting rights, right to appeal. Court hears argument by Joy as to why the bond money in each case (15CF81 - $3,000.00, 15CF123 - $3500.00) should not be forfeited. State responds - no position. Court - bond - does not find good cause has been shown for failure to appear in Court - forfetits bond.
