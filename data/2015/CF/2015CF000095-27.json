Court agrees they are too old but the other 6 prior convictions will be allowed.  May ask if he's ever been convicted of a crime and how many.  Both counsel will discuss the other witnesses that have convictions and will come to agreement.  State has no objection to the motion in limine by the State.  Defense has no objection to State's MIL either at this time.    Defense has filed proposed jury instructions and the State will file hers later today.  Both counsel will submit proposed verdicts as well.  \n\nState has presented a Motion for Leave to Amend the Information this morning.  State explains her motion to the Court.  Defense objects to the Motion to add a Count 2 at this point and states his argument.  State responds to Attorney Krische's argument.  Court cites from the statute.  Court will take this under advisement and will make a written decision quickly.\n\nState also addresses Item 7 in her Motion in Limine:  her witness is getting a doctor's written excuse as to why she needs to testify by phone.  Court grants that request as long as she gets the written excuse and it's provided to the defense.
