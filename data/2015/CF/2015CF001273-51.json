Jennifer Tanck-Adams appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Court Reporter: Darlene Shue.\nMatter has been in trial posture for some time but it has not gone yet. Defense indicates she reiterated the final offer this morning and she asks for a short turn around to allow deft time to reconsider the offer.\nDefense indicates that she is understanding that RCAP is asking that deft be removed from GPS and that he has no violations that she is aware of. The Court notes 2 violations and indicates that RCAP is going to remove the bracelet due to non payment and if they do, that would render him in violation of his bond. Defense indicates deft cannot afford GPS. The State does not object to GPS being removed.\n\nBTC: GPS may not be removed.
