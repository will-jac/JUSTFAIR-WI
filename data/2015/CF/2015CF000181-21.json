State - agrees, office has communicated with victim and they were in route to the hearing, asks court to continue. Court has victim impact statement. State - has complied with victim notification and has request for restitution. Hogan recites agreement, enter plea to amended count of sub battery 940.19(2) - count 5, enter to plea counts 1 & 7 as charged in INFO, DRI remaining counts - 3 years probation with 90 days in jail, free to argue jail time and restitution, court costs, probation conditions: anger management, no consumption of alcohol, 200 hours of community service and other standard conditions as seemed fit by DOC. State case 17CF63 would be completely dismissed and read in. Count 1 DE pleads G, Court amends Count 5 (940.19(2) - DE pleads G to amended charge, Count 7 - DE pleads G. Court has PLQ, goes over it with LaBarge. Court dismisses and reads in counts 2, 3, 4, 6 & 8 and case 17CF63 in its entirety. Court finds LaBarge is freely, voluntarily and intelligently entering her plea, waiving her constitutional rights and jury trial. Court finds factual basis to accepts pleas and adjudicates her guilty of counts 1, amended count 5 and count 7. Proceed to sentencing. State - recommends 3 years probation with 90 days in FC jail (as a condition of probation); count 5, restitution - there is a dispute on amount, a hearing may be have to be held but asks that she must pay all restitution during term of probation, AODA and follow through, no consumption or possession of alcohol, anger management and follow through with any recommendations as deemed fit by DOC, mental health evaluation, FT employment or schooling, 200 hours of community service, AW and EW. Victims are now present in the courtroom, but do not wish to make comment. Hogan makes statement, disagrees with the restitution amount for stated reasons, requesting to serve sentence in Outagamie County Jail, asks for no jail time, requesting restitution hearing and allow time to go through medical statements/history. State is requesting $21,207.92 with surcharge of $2,120.79 for a total of $23,328.71 - for AW. Hogan makes statement in regards to what her objections were with the restitution. Court will have restitution hearing set. LaBarge with holds comment. Court - Count 5 - with hold sentence and place on probation for 3 years - court costs only with DNA surcharge, must submit DNA sample, credit for one day if revoked. Conditions of probation - anger management counseling, AODA (discretion of P&P agent as she may have recently completed in another case), absolute sobriety, no contact with AW and EW, 200 hours of community service, stayed, by maintaining FT employment, if not FT employed at anytime then must do 20 hours during that month and each month after until FT employed, sentences to 90 days in FC jail, huber privileges - staying the last 30 days - if she maintains FT employment through probation then court will exempt last 30 days with huber privileges, will allow stay of report to jail for 30 days - to make arrangements for serving in Outagamie county and to secure employment, must report on or before 7 pm on 3/22/18 - must work out with both counties to make arrangements to transfer jail term and if not arranged then she must report to FC jail on that date, can start earlier if she wishes. Firearm restriction and voting rights given. Counts 1 & 7 - 2 years probation, concurrent with count 5, court costs on each count, waiving DNA surcharge on counts 1 & 7, apply bond to court costs and DNA surcharge, hold remaining amount for restitution.

Charles James Simono appeared for the State of Wisconsin. Called at 10:58 AM. Called 15CF181 and 16CF63 which is Judge Stenz's case. Attorney Hogan is only on the 15CF181 case. Court addresses 16CF63 - discussion on whether there will be a global resolution on both matters, Judge Rhode would gladly take the case but if Ms. Labarge is not going to plead to both at the same time, the matter should stay with Judge Stenz as the defendant did not file the RFS - Judge Stenz did. State will be making an offer for a global resolution but there are two separate attorneys. Hogan responds. Court advises parties to continue working the matters out. 15CF181 - Court and all parties have received the evaluation and have reviewed it. Hogan states that she has not specifically discussed the contents of it with the defendant but did provide her a copy of it. Court states that the evaluation states that the defendant was found competent and able to proceed in the criminal matter. State not objecting or offering anymore evidence. Hogan not objecting or offering anymore evidence. Court asks parties where the case is at, can proceed with FPT today. Hogan responds, found out from the State that the original offer was no longer available, received a new offer and have sent that to the defendant but has not talked to her about it, asking for anothr date for FPT. Court finds that is reasonable. Hogan puts on the record that the defendant's phone had previously been disconnected but has been informed by the defendant that it has now been reactivated. Court informs defendant to make sure she is responding to the calls/correspondence from counsel. Hogan would like PTC. State has no objections but would like a JT date.

Charles James Simono appeared for the State of Wisconsin. Called at 2:10 PM. State - resolved - plead G to count #1 as alleged, amend count #5 to a Class I felony of substantial battery contrary to 940.19(2), remaining counts to be DRI, have complied with victim notification requirements - NL did not respond - AW has responded and have provided counsel, Court and the defendant with the VIS - victim is in the Courtroom and he and other family members may wish to make statements today, parties are free to argue the conditional incarceration period, joint recommendation of 3 years probation with conditions of: restitution - defense will be asking for restitution hearing, $500.00 fine plus costs on each count, AODA and follow thru, psychological assessment and follow thru with all recommendations, anger management assessment and follow thru, no possession of alcohol and no entry into any bars, taverns or similar Class B establishments, maintain/obtain full time employment/school, no contact with AW or enter onto any premises that he owns or occupies, 150 hours of community service as approved by P&P, restitution to be paid thru probation if/when ordered. Hogan and LaBarge agree - understands that they are free to argue everything except for probation period. Court amends count #5 to substantial battery contrary to 940.19(2) - reads new charge and penalty. LaBarge pleads NC to count #1 as alleged and NC to count #5 as amended. Court dismisses and reads in counts #2, #3, #4, #6, #7 and #8. Court has plea questionnaire, attempts to go thru it, finds many issues with the defendant understanding what is happening today and the fact that if she pleads today - there will not be a chance for her to go to JT. After brief discussions, Hogan does not believe that defendant understands what is really happening today and at this point does not feel that the plea would be freely and voluntarily given. Discussion on that by all parties. Court asking if defense is just asking for more time to enter a plea or if they are possibly asking for a competency evaluation. Hogan believes it may be more of a competency issue today. Court asks more questions of the defendant prior to making its ruling on giving more time or ordering a competency evaluation. LaBarge states that she wants to proceed with pleading today. Court makes further statements and will allow the defendant a chance to satisfy both the counsel and the Court that she is competent to proceed today. LaBarge states that she would like the Court to order a competency evaluation. Court suspends today's proceedings, will sign an order for a competency evaluation, continues bond at this point, orders outpatient evaluation. State makes statement regarding adding a condition to the bond that the defendant contact her counsel at least once per week for stated reasons. Court puts an additional condition on the bond that the defendant must contact her attorney via phone at least once per week. Clerk to prepare proper paperwork for the evaluation (outpatient at this point). Court warns the defendant to make sure she attends, participates and comply with the appointments for the evaluation and if she does not, will consider keeping her in custody until that is completed. Court sets for further proceedings on 8/31/17 at 11:00 AM (either competency hearing or STC). Court puts all charges back on the table as originally charged, gives PLQ back to counsel, VIS given to clerk to be scanned in to file.  Competency hearing scheduled for August 31, 2017 at 11:00 am.
