Olds in court with attorney Patrick Howard Finlan.   Charles Simono appeared for the State of Wisconsin. Called at 1:39 PM. State - resolved - joint recommendation of DRI counts #1 and #2, count 3 amended to 948.40(4) - class A misd, plead NC/G to count #4 as alleged and to count #3 as amended, withhold sentence and place on probation for 2 years on counts #3 and #4 - concurrent to each other, with 90 days jail on count #3, other conditions of probation are: costs on each count, AODA, maintain absolute sobriety, employment/school, 125 hours of community service, no contact with any victim/child used in the crime. Olds and Finlan agree - some discussion regarding inpatient treatment as part of her jail time. Court dismisses and reads in counts #1 and #2, court amends count #3 to contributing to the delinquency of a child contrary to 948.40(4). Olds pleads NC to counts #3 and #4. Court has plea questionnaire, goes thru it, finds the defendant has freely, voluntarily and intelligently waived her constitutional rights and right to JT, accepts plea, adjudges guilty, proceed to sentencing. State makes final argument prior to sentencing - follow joint recommendation - would like a condition of no contact with RD - DOB 5/9/02, GD - DOB 1/23/07 or DP - DOB 1/26/06 - won't object to Finlan's argument of inpatient treatment as part of jail sentence (day for day - up to 45 days). Finlan makes final argument - follow joint recommendation - argues for inpatient treatment as part of jail sentence (day for day - up to 45 days). Olds makes statement, asks for inpatient treatment credit. Court sentences the defendant to the following: counts #3 and #4 - withhold sentence and place on probation for 2 years, concurrent to each other, with conditions of: count #3 - 90 days in FC jail - report today - huber allowed - eligible for community service under 973.013(3) - no credit for time spent in inpatient treatment but would consider a furlough if a bed is available, costs on each count - paid thru probation, no possession or consumption of alcohol and no entry into any bars or taverns, AODA and follow thru, 125 hours of community service, maintain/obtain full time employment/school with verbage, no contact with RD - DOB 5/9/02, GD - DOB 1/23/07 or DP - DOB 1/26/06, obtain GED, provide DNA sample, right to appeal. Finlan asks that 30 days that the defendant is to serve on a child support warrant to run concurrent to the jail ordered in this matter (11FA22). State has no opionion on that request - leaves to Court's discretion. Court - discusses matter - reviews 11FA22 - vacates committment order at this point and CSA can set for another hearing (not sure if the defendant was noticed for that hearing).","parties":[],"descr":"Final pre-trial","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-34","ctofc":"Stenz, Leon D.","date":"2016-01-06","courtRptr":"Van Cleve, Jolene"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Received documents","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-33","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"State's","parties":[],"descr":"Demand for discovery","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-32","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-29","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"RR","parties":[],"descr":"Certificate of non-service","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-28","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Cert. of appearance-JME","parties":[],"descr":"Subpoena","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-27","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Cert. of appearance-BMGP","parties":[],"descr":"Subpoena","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-26","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Cert. of appearance-JDE","parties":[],"descr":"Subpoena","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-25","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Cert. of appearance-GD","parties":[],"descr":"Subpoena","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-24","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Cert. of appearance-RPD","parties":[],"descr":"Subpoena","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-23","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Bound over for trial","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-31","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-07","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Arraignment","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-30","ctofc":"Stenz, Leon D.","date":"2015-10-07","courtRptr":"Van Cleve, Jolene"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Information","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-29","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-07","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Final pre-trial at 01-06-2016 01:15 pm","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-22","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-07","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Waiver of preliminary hearing","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CF000116-21","ctofc":"Stenz, Leon D.","date":"2015-10-07","courtRptr":"Van Cleve, Jolene"},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Tara J.
