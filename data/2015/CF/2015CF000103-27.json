Defendant appears in custody in person from Prairie du Chien Correctional with counsel SPD Paul Fredrickson.  Will hear prelim on 15CF103 and an initial appeareance on 15CF196.  Defense waives reading of complaint, waives time limits for preliminary hearing.  Court reviews right to PH within time limits.  Court finds the defendant knowingly and intelligently waives time limits in 15CF196 and will track with 15CF103.    State calls witness, A.J., sworn to testify regarding PH.  Found disabled vehicle with steam coming off it; firearm cases in the vehicle which were taken for safe keeping and other items.  Determined some of the property was found to be stolen at a later date.  Multiple people reported a male vehicle driving that vehicle and him going to residents asking for oil.  One person reported that she'd let him inside and he told her things including his name and his family connections.  The vehicle description was the same as the one encountered in the woods.  Talked to T.S. and they saw someone coming out of their house when they came home.  He said the suspect had keys his hand and he made comments of muscle cars which you cannot see unless you go into the shed they were stored in.  They gave him oil and he was on his way.  Deputy Mazur also saw a subject and later he had someone in custody.  Witness ID's defendant - record reflects ID.  Defendant did make a couple statements connecting him to the T.S. property.  Took him back to T.S. residence and the two individuals ID'd him as the one that was there.  Also spoke to Mr. K. - showed where his home was entered.  He said someone was coming in his home and he drew a weapon.  Description matched the subject Mazur had taken into custody.  Mr. K. had something reported as missing at a later time - a cell phone.  He was not charge in the K. case.  SPD Fredrickson cross-examines witness.  No DNA evidence or witness seeing him in or going into shed.  DA Fox continues questioning of witness.  Defendant gave the keys back before T.S. had armed himself.  Interviewed defendant at JASO after waiver or Miranda Rights.  He admitting taking the keys but denied being in the shed or the house.  During interview there were indicators of stimulant use - jumped from idea to idea, excitable, moving, drinking a lot of water, sores on his face.  After giving keys back he ran away to a grouping of pine trees.  Re-cross by SPD Fredrickson.  No DNA or other evidence he was inside the house.  DA calls witness, E.M, sworn and testifies.  ID's defendant - record reflects ID.  Detained him and put in handcuffs.  He asked if this was about the A-frame house which is T.S. residence.  He matched the description given by callers.  Spoke with a woman - he told her he'd been in a traffic crash.  She was trying to help him as he was disshevled and sweating.  SPD Fredrickson cross-examines witness.  No witnesses for defense, moves for dismissal and gives argument.  DA Fox gives argument against dimissal.  Court finds there is probable cause and is bound over for trial.  Information filed.  Prelim to be scheduled on 15CF196 for 45 mintues and have arraignment on both cases at the same time.
