If a representative is available, the State would make the necessary arrangements for transportation.  \nAttorney Compton would object to any kind of a continuance and would ask that if the victim on Count #1 is not available, that we still proceed to trial on Count #2. \nCourt will continue this for a status conference on Friday at 3:00 pm and will allow the defendant to appear by telephone at that time.  \nAtty Leusink is to provide Jury Instructions by Friday at noon.
