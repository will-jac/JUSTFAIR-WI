Donohoo appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  \nDefendant John G. Beles in court with Atty Dudley A. Williams.  \nMatter is before the Court for FPT.  Court notes there were a number of motions filed.  The Court first addresses the 908.08 matter.  Attorney Williams is asking Court to make a decision with regard to admissibility.  Court has not yet had a chance to review the DVD recording.  Once the Court has had a chance to review it, the Court's clerk will send the attys an e-mail with the Court's decision.  Second  issue is with regard to motion on Richard A.P. testimony.  Court recites Judge Reddy's prior ruling on this.  Atty Williams indicates that the Defense does not intend to call Dr. Woody.  Third issue  - State's Notice of Expert with regard to Paula Hocking.  Court did find transcript portion where Judge Reddy had already made an oral ruling on this issue.  Atty Williams understands that what Judge Reddy ruled was that there was a list of issues noted in the Notice.  There are a number of things that didn't seem to be relevant to this case.  It would be objectionable if the State would elicit any topics that went beyond Judge Reddy's Order.  Response by Atty Donohoo that issues is whether the defense has been put on notice of the general subject matter.  Atty Donohoo objects to some kind of limitation on Ms. Hocking's testimony.  Court references page 105 of the transcript from the hearing before by Judge Reddy.  Court agrees with State's position and Judge Reddy's ruling.  State doesn't need to detail out each separate item that the State's expert might testify to.  \n\nAtty Williams filed Motion with regard to production of exculpatory evidence.  Asst. Corp. Counsel Navis is present in Court on behalf of the County but is not making a formal appearance.  He is here to answer any questions.

The e-mails referenced by Atty Donohoo are marked as Exhibit #1.  The medical examination records are in the Departments files but they were not forwarded because they didn't contain any statements.  State received the Bellows materials in February of 2016.  Atty Donohoo notes that Defense counsel never listed Dr. Rabbitt as a witness.  \n\n3:42 pm  Response by Atty Williams with regard to the medical evaluation of the victim and whether records should be released.  \n4:56 pm  Court in session.  Court did have the CHIPS file pulled which the Court has reviewed.  At the time Judge Drettwan was the Juvenile Court  Judge, she did not authorize release of the medical records that are at issue here.  \n4:57 pm  Response by Atty Donohoo to argument made by Atty Williams.  She argues that Det. Voss had no participation in the medical exam being done.   The victim, the child, has rights.  Atty Donohoo argues that if we agree that Dr. Rabbitt's report comes in, it must include specific language from that report.  State would want to get in Dr. Rabbitt's report through either Paula Hocking or Amy Bahr.  \n5:09 pm  Response by Atty Williams that he is not comfortable with proceeding as proposed by Atty Donohoo.  He wants to see what examination was done.  Atty Williams believe it could be potentially \nineffective assistance of counsel.  5:10 pm  Response by Atty Donohoo.  5:10 pm Further argument by Atty Williams.  He believes Court has authority to release the report.  Court indicates Judge Johnson will hold a Bellows motion  tomorrow at 3:30 or Friday morning at 8:30 or he also has all Friday afternoon open.  Court will make sure that Attorney Johnson is there as GAL or that another Attorney is available as GAL.  Court orders that mother be at that hearing and that she have the child here.  Mother should contact GAL to make sure the child can speak with the GAL.  \nAtty Donohoo believes a record needs with regard to defendants waiver confrontation.   Response by Court.  Response by Atty Williams.  He believes this can be resolved if he sees the report.  \nCourt schedules Bellows motion for hearing tomorrow, Thursday at 3:30 pm before Judge Johnson.  Atty Navis will check on his calendar for tomorrow.  Atty Navis makes record as to what documents he has reviewed.

Atty Williams has no objection.  Court has signed the Order.  \nMotions in Limine filed by both sides.  Most of them are standard motions and some are duplicative.   Court grants motion to exclude witnesses from courtroom.  State will have a Court Officer; victim and her mother are also allowed to be present in Court; \nCourt will instruct jury that if they wish to discuss responses outside presence of other jurors, it will be conducted in a jury room.  No objection by Attys.  Court addresses the defendant personally on this matter.  \nDefense is asking Court give standard instructions 140 and 300  Court will do that.  Atty Donohoo also requesting credibility of child witnesses as well.  Atty Williams is asking that Court give the substantive instruction.  Court will not give that instruction in the preliminary instructions.  Court believes it could be confusing to the jury.  \nCourt addresses States motions in limine.  Jury should not hear anything about collateral consequences, about penalty or that this is a felony.   Neither side is allowed to bring out evidence as to character, reputation, etc  unless first addressed outside presence of jury.  \nDiscussion concerning Item 8a & 8b of States Motions in Limine.  Argument by Attys.  Court will not allow that type of testimony or evidence but it could be revisited.   8b  Court finds it would not be relevant or admissible.  Atty Donohoo makes further record as to 8b.  \nDiscussion as to item 9  prior records.  Atty Williams does not believe his client has any criminal record.   \nIf parties have exhibits, Court asks the parties organize them and provide them to Court's clerk for marking.  Atty Donohoo does not believe she has a whole lot of exhibits.  Court will seat 2 alternate jurors.  Court will seat 24 jurors on the box for voir dire.  Court wants to start at 8:30 am each day.  \nBoth counsel agree that the 2 files have never been joined and the bail jump file will not be tried on Monday.  \nAtty Donohoo asks Court to have colloquy with defendant with regard to any offers that the State has made in this case.  Atty Donohoo makes record as to the States offer.  \n5:47 pm  Court has colloquy with Mr. Beles with regard to States offer.  Mr. Beles understands the offer that was made to him by the State.  He is rejecting the offer.  \n5:49 pm  Court will stay in contact with both Attys via the Court's clerk.  State agrees that it will not release any witnesses without advising Atty Williams.  \n5:51 pm  Court in recess.   \n\n\n**TRANSCRIPT FILED 10-23-17: COURT REPORTER LINDA MATOSKA**","parties":[],"descr":"Final pre-trial","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000163-62","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2017-01-04","courtRptr":"Matoska, Linda"},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Motion for modification of bond","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000163-61","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-11-28","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"DA Service Fees Invoice #16-0419        $50.70","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000163-60","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-10-28","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"DA Service Fees Invoice #16-1024                   $80.00","parties":[],"descr":"Other papers","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000163-59","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-10-20","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Received documents","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000163-58","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-10-11","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Order on State's Daubert Challenge","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000163-57","ctofc":"Reddy, David M.","date":"2016-09-26","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"of Oral Decision given on August 5, 2016; Court Reporter Sandra Elderbrook","parties":[],"descr":"Transcript","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000163-56","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Final pre-trial on January 4, 2017 at 02:30 pm.\nJury trial - 12 person on January 9, 2017 at 08:30 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000163-55","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-08-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"** Transcript filed 8/9/16**\n\nCourt in session 10:00am\nDiane M.
