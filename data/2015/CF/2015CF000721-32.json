OTD dated  3/15 for failure to provide urine sample  or missed UA... KISKEN: we talked about this in depth and we feel that there is no excuse for her to have failed to appear in a timely manner and that the primary issue is she's severely addicted to H and in that regard she has brought a ltr outlining a plan from her doc recognizing the fact that she may go to jail today.

I don't know if the court has the choice to impose forced sobriety if she can't stop herself from violating. I will leave it up the the court. MOM:  either LE Phillips today after court or LAAR house. Phillips is preferred since they have an active in pt detox. CRT:  the OTD is QUASHED. I will be very frank, I had every intention of reimposing the cash bond today and if it couldn't be posted you would remain in custody until it was. Bottom line is if you are doing your part then we will work w/ you but if you leave trmt, skip appts or not involved in group or what ever is recommended by the professionals\nBOND MODIFIED: def is to be in either Mary or Mark Busheks custody from now until arrivess at LE Phillips today and she is to remain there until discharge. Atty Kisken is to set a BBH w/in 48 hrs of discharge\nYour conduct on bond has an influence on sentencing. If you won't comply w/ the trmt recommendations then it's a stmt to me that if there's trmt it's best accomplished in an inst setting.
