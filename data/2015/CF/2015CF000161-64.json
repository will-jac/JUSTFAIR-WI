Andrew Robert Herrmann appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Supt. Steve Sax appears on behalf of the Sheriff's Dept.  Defendant has filed a Request to have Huber privileges reinstated.  She was written up on 2/11 for misuse of intoxicants.  She returned to the Huber dorm and gave a lot of physical signs about being under the influence of something.  Since revocation of her work release, she has had 2 minor disciplines.  Supt. Sax will defer to the Court.  Atty Herrmann advises that the State is not taking a position.  Court notes this is the third petition that has been made by the defendant.  2:17 pm  Defendant reads statement explaining her situation and asking for Huber to be reinstated to take care of her health issues.  She has 3 surgeries that she needs.  She can take advantage of services at HHS if she is out on Huber.  Deft's best friend died of an overdose and she has had difficulty dealing with this.  Court is concerned that it appears she is putting a lot of blame on other people.
