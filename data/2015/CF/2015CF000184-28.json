ADA Jeffrey Shock appears for the State of Wisconsin.\nIn response to the Court's inquiry of Attorney Fischer whether the Amended Motion filed by the State changes the Defense position on the Motion, Attorney Fischer indicates that the Defense continues to oppose.\nThe Court grants the State's Amended Second Motion to Allow Production and Admission of Other Crimes, Wrongs or Other Acts Evidence, citing that the State intends to offer these items on the issues of knowledge, and absence of mistake or accident.  The other images are also relevant to provide context for how the investigation developed.  \nAfter Attorney Fischer requests that State be limited to only raising the 256 images and 17 videos in Rebuttal if a lack of knowledge or mistake is actually raised as a defense, the Court denies the request, finding that the evidence is admissible during the State's case in chief because the State is required to prove knowledge as one of the elements of the offense.\nThe Court grants the State's additional Motion for Other Acts; this relates to the three videos which were discovered before the search warrant was requested; this Motion is being granted on the basis of context and background.  It's also relative, to a more limited extent, on knowledge\nAs to these rulings, the Court indicates that it will give a cautionary instruction upon the request of either party. \nThe Court schedules trial; counsel agree that a two-day trial length is needed.\nThe Court indicates to Mr. Ionetz that the deadline for any settlement of the case will be at that Final Status/Scheduling Conference on August 23rd.\nThe Court continues the Bond and its conditions.\nrecess 9:33am.\n\nNEXT:  (1) FSSC on 8/23/16 at 9:00am  (2) Jury Trial (two day length) on 8/29 and 8/30/16 at 8:30am--send notices","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000184-67","ctofc":"Koschnick, Randy","date":"2016-05-09","courtRptr":"Schueler, Erica L."},{"addlTxt":"State's Amended Second Motion to Allow Production and Admission of Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts Evidence.","parties":[],"descr":"Motion","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000184-66","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-05-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"16R 006872","parties":[],"descr":"Receipt","amount":6.25,"key":"28-2015CF000184-65","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-04-05","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Court's Response to State's request for input when setting new trial date - OK - RRK","parties":[],"descr":"Response/reply","amount":null,"key":"28-2015CF000184-64","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-03-30","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"for Continuance of the presently scheduled Final Pretrial on 4-1-2016 at 8:15 am and the Jury Trial on 4-4-16 and 4-5-2016 at 8:30 am.
