Appearances given.  \nADA Diane M. Donohoo appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  \nDefendant Martin Severo Valadez appeared by PHONE (from Texas where he resides).   \nProbation Agent Janilee Wolff is present in Court.  \nMatter is on for a review of defendant's probation which is due to expire on February 2nd.  Deft has been on probation for 2 years.  The issue is whether defendant has made a good faith effort toward court obligations, specifically payment of restitution.  \n11:06 am  Atty Donohoo indicates that the Victim witness coordinator spoke with victim and victim has received some sporadic payments. Response by Defendant to Court's questions.  Defendant works at a company called Americold.  He works 40 hours a week.  Defendant lives with his parents - pays approx $350 to $400 per month.  He has a car and does not have a car payment.  He does not currently have a license.  Defendant says he can bump up his monthly payments to $100.  He also has some medical bills that he was paying.  \n11:12 am  Agent Wolff has very limited information for Mr. Valadez because he is being supervision in Texas.  Agent Wolff indicates he has been consistent with his payments and has complied with his other conditions of probation.  Mr. Valadez expects to get his license back in two weeks.  DOC believes he has made a good faith effort.  \n11:14 am  Atty Donohoo notes that the defendant has indicated he is able to pay more toward restitution.  \n11:15 am  Court makes record as to his current income and living expenses.  Court believes he was capable of making a payment of a lot more than $50 per month.  Court extends probation for 1 year and orders he pay $100 per month toward restitution.  The $100 monthly payments are to go to the victim until the victim is paid in full and then any remaining payments after that can go to the insurance company.  If he consistently makes the monthly payments as ordered during the year, he will be allowed to discharge.  \n11:18 am  Court in recess.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000133-39","ctofc":"Drettwan, Kristine E.","date":"2018-01-08","courtRptr":"Matoska, Linda"},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing on January 8, 2018 at 11:00 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"64-2015CF000133-38","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-12-07","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Records of prosec. are converted data.
