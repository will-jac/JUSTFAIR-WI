Gerald Fox appears for the State.  Refusal should have found reasonable when he plead at an earlier date.  Court states she's reviewed the alternate PSI filed, the letters also received recently, and the victim impact statements.  No victim impact statement from A.W. or A.K.  Attorney Mishlove requests to admit attorney Northcutt pro hac vice.  Attorney Northcutt files paperwork with the Court.  Court grants the motion.  State's PSI - DA Fox has no changes.  Attorney Mishlove makes a correction - defendant is still in aftercare treatment yet today.  Defense's alternate PSI - DA Fox has no changes or corrections noted.  Attorney Mishlove has no changes or corrections as well.  There are 3 of the victims present in the courtroom.  A.W. is present with her attorney.  DA Fox states there are not solid restitution figures yet at this point.  The State is requesting probation for 3 years with the OWI's at 2 years and to run concurrent.  Jail term of 6-9 months as recommended by DOC with EMP or work release if guarantee of no alcohol consumption with a SCRAM.  Conditions:  To pay restitution; maintain employment; no alcohol consumption; fine; if employer doesn't pay all the restitution the defendant should be responsible for the remainder.  Can hold restitution open for 60 days per the State so Attorney Walsh is able to file claims for his clients, A. W. and A. K.  Attorney Walsh addresses the court regarding the restitution for his clients.  He can put the restitution amounts together within 6 months.  He states he cannot put together in 6 months the total amount of damage that has been caused to his clients.  His clients are very much against work release.  Attorney Northcutt addresses the court regarding defendant's previous alcohol violation in Illinois.  He was under supervision and was not convicted in Illinois.  It was an adjudication without guilt.  Attorney Walsh continues addressing the Court.  Attorney Mishlove addresses the Court.  He requests he serve through Jackson County Jail with EMP, including SCRAM, with random testing.  No specific request for length of supervision or incarceration.  Requesting mainly be able to continue with his current employment.  No objection to any restitution requests.  Defense does not argue with any delay in determining restitution.  The claims made today they have no dispute with.  Requesting the Court follow the recommendations of both PSI's.  Defendant exercises his right to allocution.
