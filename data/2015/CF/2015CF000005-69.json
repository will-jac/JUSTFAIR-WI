Scott Blader appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Atty Robert Bellin (State's primary witness for foundation) appears via telephone.  Counsel believes primary issue before the Court today will be Def's ability to pay.  Case law submitted by the State as to contributory negligence.  Ex No 1 marked - 9/10/2015 - out of pocket expenses.  Exhibit entered and received as a summary exhibit under s. 910.06 submission made through the DA office.  $71360.52 agreed upon figure.  Def and counsel confirm she was not insured at time of crash, Victim's insurance has paid some expenses up to a point. Court receives Ex No 1 for evidentiary value and incorporates the entirety of Restitution claimed -  Atty Bellin excused from the hearing.   State is prepared to rest.  Argument by Atty Petit as to Def's ability to pay.  Def sworn in for testimony.  Direct Exam by Atty Petit.  Ex No 2 marked - Financial Disclosure Statement.  Cross Exam by DA Blader.  Re-Direct by Atty Petit.  Re-Cross by DA Blader.  Argument by Atty Petit as to contributory negligence factor/ability to pay.  Argument by DA Blader as to ability to pay - reminds the Court of charges that were dismissed and read in.  Further argument by Atty Petit.  The Court:  Must confront the agreed upon out-of-pocket expenses being requested.  Recites language from the Noll decision from the Court of Appeals and its application to this situation.  Court recognizes the challenges that Def is facing.  Finds earning capacity is currently at $10.00 per hour - earning capacity imputed at $10.00 per hour.  Imputes full time earning capability at $10.00 per hour or $1720.00 monthly as per CSUP guidelines.  Guidelines under DWD 40 of 29% or 3 children, pro rated over 3 yrs of probation as to 15CF-51 or $498.80 per month - 29% of $1720.00 imputed earnings.  Restitution obligation based upon that methodology of $17956.80 fairly assesses her capability of earnings.  Court will amend the JOC.
