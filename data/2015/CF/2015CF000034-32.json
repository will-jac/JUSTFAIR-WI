These 2 cases are set for a plea.  She's had 80 days of sobriety.  Her record is mostly misdemeanor based.  It's not a terrible record.  She would live with her mother on Brice Prairie.

There's no reason she can't do it again.  Hynek:  It's true her history is all misdemeanors but she was revoked off probation.  Given her drug addiction, I have concerns with her ability to be out in the communit without a set plan being in place.
