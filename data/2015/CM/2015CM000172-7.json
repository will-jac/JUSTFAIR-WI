Atty Harrington argues there's no direct causation to support the restitution request.  Def stipulates to hydraulic hose, front engine cover, and quick coupler.  Atty Kohler enters rebuttal, asking for joint/several responsibility.  Atty Harrington concedes joint/several responsibility, still contests causation.  Court to take restituion under advisement, will issue a decision next week.  Cases 15CM172 and 15CT50 proceed to SEHR.  Atty Harrington notes jail credit is approximately 230 days.
