Cirilli.  Charles James Simono appeared for the State of Wisconsin. Called at 9:30 AM. Called 15CM223 and 15CM231, 16TR118. State - both matters resolved - 15CM223 - witnesses have become uncooperate and moves to dismiss for that reason, 15CM231 - plead g/nc to count #1 as alleged and one misd BJ - joint recommendation of 90 days jail one each count - concurrent to each other, fine of $2009.00, 26 month DL revocation, IID, AODA. Cirilli - on 16TR118 - refusal to be found reasonable. Cirilli provides copy of letter to Court that he requested a hearing for the refusal, Court dismisses that case and finds it reasonable. Court reviews the case and is not dismissing the case at this point for stated reasons (request not filed timely) and believes it loses competency to decide that issue. Cirilli - then the defendant would be found guilty on refusal and 15CM231 would be dismissed. Discussion on how to proceed. Off record for discussion (9:47 AM). Recalled at 9:52 AM with same appearances. Court puts off record discussions on the record and the fact that the Court/State will be proceeding with the refusal (16TR118) for stated reasons and dismisses count #1 on 15CM231. Court dismisses 15CM231 and finds refusal unreasonable. 16TR118 - Court finds no timely request for hearing and finds the refusal unreasonable, finds G of the refusal, fine of $2009.00 (inclusive of costs), 26 month DL revocation, AODA, IID for 26 months on DL and all vehicles titled in his name commencing upon issuance of valid DL. Court dismisses 15CM223. 15CM231 - Court dismisses count #3. Monte plead NC to count #2 as alleged. State moves to dismiss count #1 on 15CM231 for stated reasons. Cirilli makes statement, agrees with what State has put on the record. Court dismisses count #1 on 15CM231. Court has plea questionnaire, goes thru it, finds the defendant has freely, voluntarily and intelligently waived his constitutional rights by entering his plea and right to JT, accepts plea, adjudges guilty, proceed to sentencing. Monte acknowledges 3 prior OWI convictions. State makes final argument prior to sentencing - follow joint recommendation - Monte has rejected probation, asks for court costs only. Cirilli maks final argument prior to sentencing - follow joint recommendation. Monte makes statement - asks for a week to report for stated reasons. Cirilli informs Court that this matter resolved less than a week ago. Court sentencing the defendant to the following: count #2 - 90 days in FC jail - huber and good time allowed - no credit at this point but Cirilli can research the matter and Court will take that into consideration to amend JOC - report no later than 8:30 AM on 6/24/16 - eligible for community service under 973.03(3), costs - take bond posted - remainder to be applied to fine on 16TR118 and remainder of that fine due in 60 days/CO, submit DNA sample with expunction rights given, right to appeal, adjourned. Back on the record without defendant or attorney present to discuss if a fine can be assessed on a refusal hearing. Court belives that the only penalty that one can get for a refusal is the AODA, revocation and IID. Court is going to change the sentencing to maintain the integrity of the plea agreement. Court will transfer the fine it imposed on 16TR118 to 15CM231, count #2 (count #2 will have the fine and jail and the TR will not). Court puts on the reord that it did discuss with the defendant and defense counsel what it was going to do in regards to changing the sentencing and they were in agreement with it.","parties":[],"descr":"Plea/sentencing hearing","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CM000231-30","ctofc":"Stenz, Leon D.","date":"2016-06-16","courtRptr":"Van Cleve, Jolene"},{"addlTxt":"Plea/sentencing hearing on June 16, 2016 at 09:00 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CM000231-29","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-06-13","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Jury trial on June 16, 2016 at 08:30 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"21-2015CM000231-28","ctofc":null,"date":"2016-04-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Defendant Holden S Monte in court with attorney Gary S.
