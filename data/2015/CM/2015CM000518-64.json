Failure to comply will result in other collection methods including a civil Judgment and/or suspension of your drivers license for two (2) years.  This judgment may be collected by income assignment if you fail to pay fines and costs as ordered.\n----------------------------------"}],"key":"64-2015CM000518-1-1","dispoCtofc":"Carlson, James L.","timeConds":[{"key":"tc-64-2015CM000518-1-1-1","descr":"Jail time","time":"30 Days","notes":"to commence forthwith and with work release privileges."},{"key":"tc-64-2015CM000518-1-1-2","descr":"Community service","time":"40 Hours","notes":"The defendant is to complete a total of forty (40) hours of community service work during the period of probation ordered WITHOUT buyout option."}],"dispoDesc":null,"probByCase":null,"sentDate":"2015-12-04","isConverted":false,"reOpenedEvent":null,"action":"Guilty Due to Guilty Plea"}],"pleaDate":"2015-12-04","descr":"Resisting or Obstructing an Officer","offenseDate":"2015-11-05","id":"64-2015CM000518-1","pleaDescr":"Guilty","chargeModifiers":[],"dispoDesc":"Guilty Due to Guilty Plea","statuteCite":"946.41(1)","severity":"Misd.
