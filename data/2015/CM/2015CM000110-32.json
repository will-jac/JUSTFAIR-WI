She's paid $282.\nCourt:  So there's no question about the 15CM-110 discharging.\nFrise:  That would just be the court costs.\nSkemp didn't have notice of what this hearing is about and even the correct case is not even on the calendar.\nCourt:  What we're concerned about is 14CF-202.\nSkemp:  The victimin that case is K-Mart.
