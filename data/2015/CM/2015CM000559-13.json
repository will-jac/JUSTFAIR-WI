Cross exam by Atty Khandhar. Re-direct exam by ADA Strebe. Witness excused at 10:23 a.m. Argument by ADA Strebe-defn is not competent at this time, but can be restored within the time period with treatment. State req the defn to committed to an inpatient treatment. Atty Khandhar obj to inpatient treatment if the CT finds the defn be committed. Argument by Atty Khandhar. CT makes findings and finds defn is not competent to proceed, but finds he is likely to be restored within 12 mo with treatment and medication. Parties stipulate to 79 days of credit for 17CT517 and 75 days credit for 17CM2107. CT calls defn case 15CM559 because the ALJ submitted letter requesting competency determination. CT adopts findings from 17CT517 and 17CM2107 into 15CM559, and enters the same order. CT will enter 79 days credit into that order.","parties":[],"descr":"Competency hearing","amount":null,"key":"13-2015CM000559-26","ctofc":"McNamara, Nicholas J","date":"2018-01-22","courtRptr":"Rauber, Erin"},{"addlTxt":"from State of Wisconsin/Division of Hearings and Appeals RE Request for a Competency Determination","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"13-2015CM000559-25","ctofc":null,"date":"2018-01-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Records of prosec. are converted data.
