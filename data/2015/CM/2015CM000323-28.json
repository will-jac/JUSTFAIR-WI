Have been attempting a global resolution with ADA Teuber on all of Mr. Lafferty's cases, and in review of cases, did notice that prior counsel had filed a request for substitution but that was denied as being untimely. Reviews case history and requests the Court reconsider motion for substitution, and that all assigned cases to Mr. Lafferty be assigned to another branch as well. Mr. Lafferty is being revoked on a Dodge County matter, so resolving these matters expeditiously is not formost matter. \nADA Shock takes no position on request\nCourt finds that the Defendant appeared in custody, with Atty Hagemann on 9/8/15 & that Mr. Lafferty was represented by SPD at that time as they would be appointing counsel, a not guilty plea was entered at that time. The request for substitution was not filed until 10/28/15, more than a month after the initial appearance and the assigned Judge was known on 9/8/15. On 9/14/15 a notice of hearing was generated showing the Court official as Judge Wambach, so if there was confusion, since Judge Hue conducted the initial appearance, the assigned Judge should then have been known. Under 971.05(3) the Court shall even if Mr. Lafferty did not have Counsel, enter a plea at arraignment.
