State makes final argument prior to sentencing - follow joint recommendations. Burns makes final argument prior to sentencing - follow joint recommendation. Herrera makes statement - requests jail credit of 1 day on 15CM04 and 22 days on 15CM38 and apply that credit to 15CM04. State argues - no legal basis - will stipulate to 1 day credit on 15CM04.
