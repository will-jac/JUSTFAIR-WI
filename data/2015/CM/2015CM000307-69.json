No payments in 2014 - few payments in 2015 - contempt of 120 days ordered w/Purge conditions to commence 6/1/2015 - $100 per mo PP - her position that the stay should be lifted and Def should serve the 120 days or make a substantial payment.  Statement by Def:  States he had indicated to the COC that he could pay approx $500.  Def did post $193 last night as to 15CM-151.  The Court:  Lifts the stay of contempt sentence due to the muliple opportunities given for payment.  Stay vacated and will require the 120 days to be served.
