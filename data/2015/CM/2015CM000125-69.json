Brudnowski in court, appearing pro se.  Steven Paul Anderson appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Agent Jannisa Koch from DOC also present in court.   Per correspondence received from DOC, Def does not have access to required programming ordered.  Court is concerned this matter was just brought to the Court's attention just prior to expiration of supervision - 2 wks prior.  Statement by ADA:  Options are available in neighboring counties - i.e., Winnebago.  The hope from the State is that DAAP treatment would still take place in light of convictions.  Statement by Agent Koch - speaks that Green Lake terminated their programming 6-7 yrs ago. Winnebago clients are referred to Lutheran Social Services - not technically a DAAP program.  Explains therapy provided during supervision.  Specific Anger Mgmnt treatment not completed - some completed thru therapist.  Statement by Defendant.  Previous joint venture has been sold and has solved the underlying problems.  Extreme financial situation have been somewhat resolved and continuing on supervision would add to the financial hardship.  Local DAAP was lost in this county approx over 1 yr ago.  Further statement by Def - previous agent was supposed to address this problem with the Court and that was not taken care of before she left. Def also has had 2 temporary agents before being assigned with Agent Koch.  Single violation reported on by Agent Koch while on supervision.  Court questions Agent as to the loss of this DAAP service.  Agents continue to receive training on utilization of DAAP tools and this gap may be filled locally by providing oversight with an educational and therapeutic model within.  This protocol with a change journal was completed by Def - compliance with assignments and project was accomplished in full in January 2017.  Agent feels Def has made progress during supervision and its a hardship to complete DAAP with the unavailability.  Further statement by Def as to treatment completed with DHS on AODA issues.  Successful goals completed thru AODA as per discharge report.  The Court:  Upset with prior agent that this problem of unavailability was not brought forth for the Court to address sooner.  Court is saddened by the loss of this programming due to its prior involvement and being instrumental in setting up this programming almost 20 yrs ago.  Takes note of progress made with the tools available.  Understands the financial hardships that exist within the household.  Court makes the determination that components of supervision have been complied with.  Expects that Def will be successfully discharged from supervision on the expected date.  Very little would be accomplished with any extension of supervision.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000125-39","ctofc":"Dutcher, Guy D","date":"2017-03-23","courtRptr":"Gulbrandsen, Tara"},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing on March 23, 2017 at 10:45 am.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000125-38","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-03-14","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Letter from DA Blader in response to DOC request -  - the Court will set a hearing to address this issue","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000125-37","ctofc":"Dutcher, Guy D","date":"2017-03-09","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Electronic Filing Notice Mailed","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000125-35","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-03-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Case Converted to Electronic Filing","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000125-34","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-03-08","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"from DOC requesting an amendment to the JOC to state that the DE must complete any assessments and treatment as requested by the DOC as Waushara Co does not have a certified DAAP","parties":[],"descr":"Letters/correspondence","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000125-36","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-03-06","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Payment application agreement","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000125-33","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-11-20","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADDRESS INFO for Anthony J.
