Defendant Scott F Ufferman in custody.  Charles James Simono appeared for the State of Wisconsin. Called at 2:35 PM. Court - here for motion for stay pending appeal. Kennedy states motion, asking for a stay of execution pending appeal although he only has about 12 days jail remaining to serve (if credit is figured correctly), record should be at COA within 20 days from today, asking for a stay on the fine owed, also asking for stay on DL revocation for stated reasons. Court puts on the record why this motion hearing was not heard as originally scheduled on 9/1/16. Court asking if Kennedy is asking for the withdrawal of the motion to stay the jail sentence. Kennedy responds, only has 12 days left to serve. State makes argument on the motion, but first wants to hear from the defendant if he is withdrawing his motion to stay the jail sentence. Ufferman leaves it as the discretion of the Court in regards to stay of the jail term. Defendant does indeed withdraw the motion for stay of jail sentence pending appeal. Court grants that request. State argues motion, not taking a position on the motion to stay the DL revocation but makes argument in regards to the stay of the fine assessed. State objects to the statement by defendant that they will win on the merits of the appeal. Kennedy responds, still requesting the stay of the payment of the fine, believes the DL revocation stay is automatic with DOT. Court asks if Kennedy is withdrawing the part of the motion for the stay of DL revocation. Kennedy agrees. Court will only hear the motion on the stay for the payment of the fine. Court makes decision - reviews the merits of the appeal - does not see a great chance that the defendant will win the appeal - denies the motion to stay the fine and the fine is to be paid within the statutory period. Kennedy asks about the assessment part of the DL revocation. Court - did not rule on that as Kennedy had previously withdrawn that. Kennedy makes statement in regards to class. Discussion on if Kennedy is asking the Court to rule on something else today. Kennedy will contact DOT in regards to that and if there is issues, it will contact the court.
