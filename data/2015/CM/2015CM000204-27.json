ADA Melissa Inlow appears for the State.  Defense filed motion to dismiss/suppress.  He clarifies what his motion entails.  It's both to dismiss and supress.  DA gives her argument addressing both.  Pringle issue - probable cause in complaint.  Defense gives his argument to this issue.  Court states there is a basis stated that supports the criminal complaint as charged.  The stop - no factual claim supporting the motion. LInehan states the vehicle was followed for 6 block and then parked.  Court states it was 3:00 a.m. so it was dark and a lamp wasn't lit.  State calls 1st witness, Officer J.J., sworn, testifies.  Followed vehicle up hills and the license plate was not lit.  Traffic stop initiated as the vehicle was turning onto S. 8th Street, then it pulled into parking lot and stopped.  ID'd driver, explained reason for stop.  ID'd male in back of vehicle.  Dispatch ran each person in the vehicle.  Defendant and Shane Colvin were on probation at that time.  Could smell odor of alcohol.  PBT'd Shane, he wouldn't look at officer, constantly moving, talking.  Deputy Olson also present at this time.  Defense cross examines witness.  Saw vehicle coming down bridge with Deputy Olson behind it.  It crossed in front of me and Deputy Olson was no longer behind it.  The car's exhaust was loud.  Pulled over after 5 blocks.  Noticed license plate light not lit when it passed me to go up the hills.  I turned squad lights on as I turned left behind vehicle.  They turned into parking lot.  Driver stated it was her vehicle and didn't know there was insurance in the vehicle.  Then addressed backseat passenger.  Deputy Olson was at the car window when I was at my squad.  He instructed to detain the subjects at this time.  Placed him in handcuffs.  Judge - How is the relavant to defendant's case?  Defense - Ok.  Detained all subjects at that time.  Participated in a search - did not ask for consent.  Judge - defendant was a front seat passenger, not driver.  Witness excused.  State calls 2nd witness, Officer A.O., sworn, testifies.  Heard Officer J.J.'s call and met him when he was walking back from initial contact with vehicle.  I held cover on passenger side and asked for ID's.  Made contact with defendant in front.  Ran checks on both parties - on probation with a condition for no narcotics.  They appeared nervous, she moved her foot back near a sunglass case on the floor.  Appeared to be trying to move it.  Inside case were 2 glass pipes with white residue.  Advised other officer we'd be detaining the subjects.  Also found a mirror with residue, other items found in vehicle.  Defense cross examines witness.  Did not see case fall out of glove box.  There was a lot of motion.  She was looking through the glove box.  Asked her what was in it and she handed it to me.  She wouldn't make face contact with me when answering questions.  Witness excused.  Defense has no witnesses.  Court makes a finding there was no factual basis for the Motion.  Court addresses each issue presented in Motion and testimony given today.  Motion is denied.  Case will be set for jury trial.  Attorney Linehan will contact Judge's Office to schedule.","parties":[],"descr":"Motion hearing","amount":null,"key":"27-2015CM000204-26","ctofc":"Becker, Anna","date":"2015-11-24","courtRptr":"Wolfe, Jenny"},{"addlTxt":"Subpoena and Certificate of Appearance served on Officer J.W.J. to appear at 11/24 motion hearing.","parties":[],"descr":"Subpoena","amount":null,"key":"27-2015CM000204-25","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-11-04","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion hearing at 11-24-2015 03:30 pm","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"27-2015CM000204-24","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-27","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion hearing at 11-04-2015 09:00 am","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"27-2015CM000204-23","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Motion hearing at 10-23-2015 10:00 am","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"27-2015CM000204-22","ctofc":null,"date":"2015-10-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"ADA Melissa Inlow appears for the State.
