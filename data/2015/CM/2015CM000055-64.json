Weingandt\n    was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. The defendant\n    was found guilty of actually committing the <nobr>crime(s)</nobr> charged,\n    but was also found not to be legally responsible under Wis. Stats. 971.165\n    for committing the <nobr>crime(s)</nobr> because of the defendant's mental\n    condition. The legal effect of a finding of not guilty by reason of mental\n    disease or defect is that the court must commit the defendant to the\n    custody of the Department of Health and Family Services.\n  </p><p data-section-name=\"notice\">\n    <strong>Notice to employers:</strong> It may be a violation of state law to\n    discriminate against a job applicant because of an arrest or conviction\n    record.
