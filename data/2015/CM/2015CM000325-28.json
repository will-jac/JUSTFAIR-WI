ADA Jeffrey Martin Shock appeared for the State of Wisconsin.\nCounsel agree that the procedural posture is that these cases are before the Court on warrant return\nAtty Jurek informs the Court that he has an issue to address before addressing warrants. Have been attempting a global resolution with ADA Teuber on all of Mr. Lafferty's cases, and in review of cases, did notice that prior counsel had filed a request for substitution but that was denied as being untimely. Reviews case history and requests the Court reconsider motion for substitution, and that all assigned cases to Mr. Lafferty be assigned to another branch as well. Mr. Lafferty is being revoked on a Dodge County matter, so resolving these matters expeditiously is not formost matter. \nADA Shock takes no position on request\nCourt finds that the Defendant appeared in custody, with Atty Hagemann on 9/8/15 & that Mr. Lafferty was represented by SPD at that time as they would be appointing counsel, a not guilty plea was entered at that time. The request for substitution was not filed until 10/28/15, more than a month after the initial appearance and the assigned Judge was known on 9/8/15. On 9/14/15 a notice of hearing was generated showing the Court official as Judge Wambach, so if there was confusion, since Judge Hue conducted the initial appearance, the assigned Judge should then have been known. Under 971.05(3) the Court shall even if Mr. Lafferty did not have Counsel, enter a plea at arraignment. Court denies motion for reconsideration and further concludes that the motion for substitution was not improperly denied.\nADA Shock informs the Court that they were not aware Mr. Lafferty's probation was to be revoked, requests time to speak with defense counsel\nRecess: 1:22 pm Reconvene: 1:23 pm\nADA Shock informs the Court that they withdraw motion to modify bond and request that the bond be reinstated, presents basis including that the Defendant will be in-custody and will be able to be brought to court\nNo objection from Atty Jurek\nCourt concludes that without imposition of cash, Mr. Lafferty will appear.
