Anderson in court, appearing in person.  Steven Paul Anderson appeared for the State of Wisconsin.  Agent Stockwell also present in Court.  Statement by Agent Stockwell - Def initially requested the 18 mos review.  In addition the Department is requesting a review of probation conditions and conditions of bond.  Statement by Defendant as to absolute sobriety and firearm restriction.   Argument by ADA - State would object to any further amendment to Absolute Sobriety and lifting of any firearm restrictions.  Appropriate terms to remain in place.  Argument by Agent Stockwell - agrees with the ADA's argument and his views.  The Court:  No basis to modify the alcohol restrictions and will remain in place.  Chapter 950 in compliance and victim present in courtroom.  ADA did confer with victim and victim will ask the court as well to allow restrictions to remain in place.  Victim does have a request for amendment to geographical restrictions that she would want addressed further by the Court today.  As to firearm restriction: Due to convictions entered and concerns stated, the Court determines it is an appropriate condition to continue and prohibition as to no possession of any firearms is to remain and Court denies request to amend any firearm restriction.  15CM-24:  Agent Stockwell requests clarification as to absolute sobriety and bar prohibition ordered.  JOC and bond conditions are in conflict.   Explains challenges of supervising Defendant due to lack of compliance on Defendant's part.    Court cannot further address DOC's concerns today on any competency issues, etc.  Agent is speaking regarding another case which that case is not before the Court today and will not be addressed without any notice to Defendant (16CF-13).  Further statement by Defendant as to violation of no contact alleged.  Court reminds Defendant that this issue is not before the Court today and will not be addressed today.   Court:  Will amend conditions of supervision as to prohibitions - Defendant is to avoid liquor stores, stay out of establishments known as bars or taverns with the main purpose of sale or serving alcohol on the premises.  Restaurant would be allowed for the sole purpose of eating.  Must stay out of the bar areas.  Defendant understands this amendment.  The other case will be dealt with once that case comes up for review (16CF-13).    ADA argues on behalf of the victim for an amendment of conditions of probation to also include geographical restrictions. That request was previously denied in the TRO case.  Victim would request an amendment of the conditions of supervision as to this case to include that geographical restriction.  Court declines to order at this time, cannot be added as opportunity has since passed for request by victim.  Further statement by Defendant.  Court reminds Defendant we are not here today to discuss competency, an issue to be dealt with when that matter comes before the Court.  Court will not mix or match cases today.","parties":[],"descr":"Probation review hearing","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000024-117","ctofc":"Wolf, Todd P","date":"2017-07-20","courtRptr":"Bertram, Brenda"},{"addlTxt":"Petition and Order for Writ of Habeas Corpus ad Prosequendum-Waupaca County Jail","parties":[],"descr":"Petition for writ of habeas corpus","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000024-116","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-07-17","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Transcript of judgment issued","amount":0.00,"key":"69-2015CM000024-115","ctofc":"Zamzow, Melissa","date":"2017-07-14","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Notice of entry of judgment","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000024-114","ctofc":"Zamzow, Melissa","date":"2017-06-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"to withdraw counsel","parties":[],"descr":"Order","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000024-113","ctofc":"Wolf, Todd P","date":"2017-06-19","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"Probation review hearing on July 20, 2017 at 01:15 pm.","parties":[],"descr":"Notice of hearing","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000024-112","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-06-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Notice of assignment of judge","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000024-109","ctofc":"Zamzow, Melissa","date":"2017-06-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Order assigning judge/judicial assignment order","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000024-108","ctofc":"Wolf, Todd P","date":"2017-06-15","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"to Withdraw as Counsel","parties":[],"descr":"Proposed Order","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000024-111","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-06-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"to Withdraw as Counsel","parties":[],"descr":"Petition","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000024-110","ctofc":null,"date":"2017-06-12","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":null,"parties":[],"descr":"Application for specific judicial assign approved","amount":null,"key":"69-2015CM000024-107","ctofc":"Dutcher, Guy D","date":"2017-06-02","courtRptr":null},{"addlTxt":"11:24 am case called.

Anderson in court with attorney Thomas W. Johnson.  Scott C. Blader appeared for the State of Wisconsin. DA Blader - PPDA has been offered to the defendant which he has declined. Atty Johnson - DE is not wishing to enter a plea to these charges. DE is rejecting the offer of the State. The court has gone through the transcript that has been filed in detail. The court finds that the discussion with the court commissioner pertained to the victim's mail that the defendant may receive. Statement by DA Blader regarding 904.04(2) evidence. Feels that the 904.04(2) evidence is appropriate - DE deliberately tried to contact the victim after the injunction was in place. Is requesting all the letters written by the DE be allowed as evidence. Also requesting that the behavior that lead up to the request for the injuction be admitted.  Argument by Atty Johnson regarding 904.04(2) evidence. The court finds that the issue at hand is the mind set of the DE when the letters were written after the injunction was in place. In order to determine the intent of the defendant after the injunction was in place it would have to be shown what the DE's behavior was to bring about the injunction in the first place. The behavior of the defendant prior to the injunction was in place is relevant in determining the defendant's intent when writing the letters after the injunction was issued. The court will permit evidence mentioned in the application for the injuction and occurring in the 6 months proceeding the injunction. 13 jurors to be impaneled, 4 strikes per side, 21 in the box. Jury trial to be rescheduled. Motion by Atty Johnson to amend the bond to allow the defendant to be able to have alcoholic beverages. DA Blader - voices an objection to any amendment of bond. The court respectfully declines any modification of the bond.
