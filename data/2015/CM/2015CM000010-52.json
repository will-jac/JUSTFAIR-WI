Def has indicated that he thought the just-filed matter was previously subject to no-prosecution.  ADA Forehand states that the charges in the complaint just filed results from a just-completed investigation; notes that the bond was previously dismissed but DA has decided to file on the charges.  ADA states that she had said \"Ms. Harper is not filing charges at this time,\" not that the charges weren't going to be brought.\n\n15CM10 - ADA asks for 1k signature bond with no contact with N McBain; also asks for no drink as part of that bond with test-on-demand requirement; no bars/taverns.

M states that, because of the no contact in 15CF2, Def doesn't have a place to stay; states def is abiding by his curfew, keeping in mind that he also has to report to the jail the following day for another condition; def not driving so has to have help with transportation; for that reason, stays where he has to in order for that to happen.  Atty. M states that the def has been taking medications as prescribed and ordered; in compliance with bond with daily taking/reporting to the sheriff's dept.  \n\nAtty. M asks for modification of the 15CF2 bail; states victim wants to request drop of the no contact condition on that bond; states that, if the Court dropped that no contact, def wouldn't have the issues he's having with where he's residing and the arrangements he's having to make to comply with the other conditions.  ADA Forehand - State \"vigorously objects\" to Atty. M's request for bond modification.  Arguments presented by both counsel.  Victim address court, asking for deletion of the no contact.  Court denies the modification as requested.  Atty. M argues for curfew condition to be dropped; suggests that, if court wants the curfew, wants to know if it would be acceptable that the def calls the jail every night to tell them where he's at.  Court asks if def can \"narrow down the places where he will be ... to three or four places.\"  Def addresses Court.  Court removes the curfew and leaves all other conditions in effect.  ADA states she wants to be on-the-record in opposition of the curfew removal.  Curfew restriction removed.  Other conditions remain.\n\n15CM10 - Court orders 1k signature bond.
