DA Blader requesting a separate hearing to address the \"Daubert\" motion. Atty Szilagyi requesting an adjournment of the trial date due to unavailability of an expert witness. Statement by DA Blader. The Court will clear the trial and will schedule the motion hearing on that date to hear the \"Daubert\" motion. Jury Trial rescheduled to a date that conforms with the expert witness. DA Blader raises the issue of the jury instruction regarding the specific instruction that states what substance the defendant was under the influence of at the time of the offense. The Court advises counsel as to how the instruction will be crafted but will finalize the issue at the hearing on March 17th. DA Blader - another issue to be address is the mode of ingestion of the impairing substances. Statement by Atty Szilagyi - would like additional time to review that issue. The Court requests any subsequent motions to be filed by the parties by no later than March 4, 2016. DA Blader requesting a specific instruction be crafted regarding the playing of portions of the video of the stop. Statement by Atty Szilagy - only received the video this morning and has not had a opportunity to review at this point. Does not have any insight to offer at this time but does not foresee there being an issue. The Court does not believe that there will be an issue with the playing of only portions of the video of the stop to protect the defendant's rights. The parties stipulate as to the number of prior convictions to be stated should the defendant testify.The Court addresses the \"Old Chief\" stipulation by the defendant. The Court finds that that is a knowing, voluntary and intelligent \"Old Chief\" stipulation entered.
