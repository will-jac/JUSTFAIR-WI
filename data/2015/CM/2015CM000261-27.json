Judge instructs clerk to re-print list for peremptory challenges.  Jury back in and on record at 10:48 and strikes resumed prior to going back on the record.  Jury selected and sworn at 10:55.  Short break for jurors to make calls.  Back on record at 11:05 and Judge begins preliminary instructions.  Opening statements begin at 11:22 and end at 11:29.  State calls first witness, C. P. sworn, and testifies.  Record reflects ID of defendant.  He was there to help put up fire alarms at his grandmother's hotel.  Officer James responded.  Witness also received a disorderly conduct citation due to the event.  We both went outside and were separated by the officer.  Witness states he gave statement of what happened to the officer.  Observed Officer James interview Brady.  He put witness in a head lock - he was angry, didn't want me there.  Witnessed officers interviewing defendant - raised voice of brother, animated movements.  Officer James did not act inappropriately and didn't treat him any differently than he had treated himself.  Cross-examination by defense.

Located in City of BRF, Jackson County, WI.  Separated the two and made contact with C.P. first; he was cooperative.  Issued C.P. a DC citation as felt he contributed to the situation by arguing and pushing each other.  Principle aggressor was the defendant.  States how he determined that.  Phone was located in office of E & F Hotel.  Made contact with defendant next to deputy's squad.  Explained how he interviewed parties.  Defendant seemed very aggitated and raised his voice numerous times.  States what defendant said to him.  Defendant told officer that he couldn't pat him down.  After asking to pat him down for location of cell phone he pulled his shorts and t-shirt off.  Very strange reaction.  No body cameras at that time.  Filed a narrative report which was put into evidence.  Observed that he didn't have the phone.  Defendant handed him the shorts to search them.  He states he didn't and handed them back to him.  He had continued to be aggitated or further actions would be taken, continued raising voice.  Reached for handcuffs and he took off.
